## 2021 UL Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns RoboBoat

Welcome to the [University of Louisiana at Lafayette's](https://louisiana.edu) entry into the [2021 RoboBoat Competition](https://roboboat.org/programs/2021/). This is the Ragin' Cajuns' third design submission to RoboBoat. We are very excited to show off our progress through the past nine months, so please take a look and enjoy!
