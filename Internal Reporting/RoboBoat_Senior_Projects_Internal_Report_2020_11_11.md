# Integration of a UAV to the RoboBoat to aid in task completion and navigation

## Long-term Project Goal

Integrate a rotary UAV to the RoboBoat to increase the points gained while completing certain tasks and aid in navigating the courses more efficiently.

## Short-term Goal

To complete a working final draft of the Evaluation Matrix, work on final report and present final presentation Thursday, November 12th. 

## Recent Results Overview

1. As a team, we went back through the [Specification Sheet, House of Quality, and Function tree](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools) and have updated the comments that were given to us and continued to iterate these tools. **Team**

2. We are 95% done with the [Morphological Chart](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools) and will have it finished by Thursday 11/12/2020. We made edits suggested by Dr. Vaughan in last meeting to expand the "ROS" sections into more defined solutions. **Team**

3. We finished making the edits on our final presentation as suggested by Dr. Vaughan. **Team**

4. The old enclosure is completely taken apart and the individual parts are labeled. The final design of the enclosure mount has not been determined. 

5. Battery chargers have been selected based on overall reviews from hobbyist that have used them. [Battery Chargers  Comparison Sheet](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools) 

6. We have started working on our final report that is due Friday November 20th 2020.

## Questions/Comments

1. Do we want to avoid re-designing the individual mounts that were created for the electronics? 


## Plan for the next two weeks

1. Revise working final drafts of design tools
2. Finish compiling a Morphological Chart
3. Complete an Evaluation Matrix to get a final conceptual design finalized
4. Figure out how to ssh into the Stingray over Wifi
5. Begin compiling Final Presentation charts and graphs and finish the final paper
6. We filled out the intent to compete form and are still waiting to completely register with RoboNation
7. Attend RoboBoat meeting on Friday 11/13/2020 at 6:00pm

### What are your next steps?

#### As a team

1. Finish revisions of current design tools
2. Work on final report (Finish outline and work on abstract and introduction)
3. Finish the Morphological Chart and submit for review
4. Finish the evaluation matrix and submit for review
5. Use the design tools to come to a conclusion for the final UAV design
6. Write and submit proposal for UAV

#### Individually

1. I (Brennan) plan to continue diving into ROS. I have some Udemy courses that I can leverage to learn ROS basics. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team. Work on finalizing the electronics mount and helping on the design tools and final report and presentation as needed.

2. I (Nathan) plan to work on an online course which will include learning the basic control of a drone, drone exploration, and drone navigation. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle.

3. I (Ben) plan to get into understanding the basics of ROS and I will be helping out wherever I am needed. I (as well as the rest of the team) will also be working on adding more to the Specification Sheet, morphological chart, and the Evaluation Matrix. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle.

4. I (Joseph) will be working mainly focusing on finalizing our Morph Chart and Eval Matrix and completing our final report.

### What work do you expect to have done by next report? What results to you expect?

By next report, we expect to have all design tools completed and a final UAV design determined.

### Are we on schedule with respect to the GitHub Project and/or Gantt Chart?

No we are not on schedule for this semester, but we are working diligently to catch up and get back on pace.

# Long-term planning

We want to have the final design concept decided by the end of the semester. We would like to have the UAV flying autonomously with a camera attached to the bottom of it within a pre-defined area by the begging of next semester. We want to fully test this design by late February, early March to have time to correct the flaws in the coding and design. We are looking to have the UAV fly autonomously with a camera attached to it, collect data that represents objects, raise/deliver an object, and have the UAV integrated with ASV by the end of next semester.

## Up coming Paper Deadlines


1. Final Team Presentations: November 12th 
2. Final Report is due Friday November 19th by 11:59PM

## Administrative Deadlines

None yet. Waiting on rules form RoboNation to be released
