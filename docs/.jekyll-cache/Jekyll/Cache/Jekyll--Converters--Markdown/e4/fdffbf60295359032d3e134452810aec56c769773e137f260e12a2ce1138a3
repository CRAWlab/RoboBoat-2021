This team developed the Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV) from scratch. This ASV had to follow specific <a href="https://robonation.org/app/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/RoboBoat-2019-Rules-and-Task-Description_v2.pdf">guidelines</a> given by <a href="https://robonation.org/">RoboNation</a> and a few items to note from these guidelines is that the ASV must be autonomous, configured with an E-Stop, and have the electronics protected from water. For the ASV, it must float in water and propelled by the teams choice. The ULL 2019 RoboBoat Team decided to go a different route than most other teams, which was to create a pontoon boat with thrusters in an x-configuration. The materials used to build the hull for the ASV was foam, adhesive, epoxy, fiberglass and paint. The foam was cut into planar shapes with a waterjet which were then glued together and sanded to form a pontoonâ€™s hull sturcture. From there, the team prepared the hulls to marry the brige, which is what is used to help keep the boat stable as it is moving in the water. 
<br /></p>

<p>The preparation that was completed was adding a first layer of epoxy to both the hulls and the bridge, which would take 18 to 24 hours to cure. Next, was inlaying fiberglass sheets on top of the epoxy. This was completed by adding an inner and outer layer of fiberglass right on top of eachother. A final layer of epoxy was added ontop of the fiberglass, which then was left to cure for 18 to 24 hours. After that, a fairing compound was used, which was layed over the epoxy to seal the pores of the materials so the ASV can be used as a marine vessel. This fairing compound took 12 to 15 hours to cure and turned to a greenish color when it was fully dry. This fairing compound was then sanded to a smooth finish and then spray painted black.</p>

<p>After the hull and bridge were coated for marine use, they were assembled and the electronics were installed. The first of the many electronics to be installed on the system, were the four T200 Thursters from Blue Robotics. These trusters were positioned on the ASV in an x-configuration to allow for holonomic motion, which allows for pure surge, sway, and yaw, as seen in the video below. Due to the pue surge, sway, and yaw, this boat is able to make tight turns as well as move directly to the left or right without the need to move forward or backwards. This setup allows the ASV to parallel park a lot quicker than a traditional setup and it also allows for quicker movements around buoys, which is a big advantage for this competition. In this video below, it is showing a demonstration on how this boat actually moves with these thrusters configured in the x-configuration and it is really a proof of concept. Also, this video will be showing the very first time this ASV touched the water and moved under its own power!</p>

<p>After this ASV was tested and seen to be a possible design, it was now time to add all the rest of the electronics in the electronics enclousre. This electronics enclosure is a monoprice weatherproof hardcase. It was used do its ability to keep water out from the electronics and it was fairly priced. The special part about all of these electronics is the E-Stop. This E-Stop uses a hartbeat signal and when it is pressed the system automatically shuts down. As seen in this video, the E-Stop works great! There are two E-Stops on this ASV and one handheld E-Stop. This setup follows the guidelines for RoboBoat by allowing for the ASV to shutoff from a distance as well as through mounted E-Stops on the boat. The two E-Stops on each side are there for ease of access if shutting down the ASV is needed. Also, the Robot Operating System (ROS) was used on this system. ROS was used to map using <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping">GMapping</a> and this was done by using the ZED stereo camera and Hokuyo Scanning Rangefinder on the bow of the boat. GMapping is the most simplistic form of mapping as it is creating a 2-D map. GMapping also allows for path planning to be used, which is incredibly helpful in guiding the ASV to its destination.

<p><br /></p>

<p>Now it was time for the team to compete at the competition, but there was a big obstacle the team had to overcome. This obstacle was that all four of the T200 thrusters housings had broken and the housings needed to be replaced. Luckily, Dr. Vaughan had ordered extras in preperation for a case like this! So, the 2019 Team worked on replacing the housings and at the end of the day even though the weather was not on their side, they were able to put the boat out on the water! What the ASV being on the water proves is that the design was able to meet all the specifications on safety requirements and it was able to be autonomous. So, needless to say, this boat was a success!</p>

<p>During the school year of 2019 to 2020, the ULL RoboBoat Team focused on the coding aspect for the ASV. There were areas of improvement that this team sought out to improve upon, such as creating a better way for the ASV to view its surroundings. This was done by adding a second ZED camera and Hokuyo Scanning Rangefinder on the stern ASV, which allowed for better viewings of the surroundings for the ASV. They also upgraded the mapping agortihm from <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping">GMapping</a> to <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap">RTab-Map</a>. RTab-Map is a 3-D mapping algorithm that uses loop closure, which helps increase the accuracy of the system. This video shows what RTab-Map produces with a Kinect camera, which is very similar to the ZED stereo camera. Also, with this new system design there would be a need for more processing power, which would produce a lot more heat than the team was comfortable with in the enclosure that the 2019 RoboBoat Team used, so the ULL 2020 RoboBoat Team ventured out and was able to find a sponsor to donate a new enclosure for this ASV. This new enclousre is perfect for the computing power needed for all the new electronics input on the ASV. In the video below, it is showing the new CAD model of the ASV with all the new hardware added.</p>

<p>For the 2020 Competition, the team was unable to complete the install of these new components onto the system, but this was taken care of 
by the 2021 RoboBoat Team. Also, the ULL 2020 RoboBoat Team obtained 2nd place overall in the competition. This competition was hosted virtually and what was graded was the Technical Design Report, Website, and Video. The Technical Design Report was ranked 3rd place out of the 10 teams that competed. This was a huge accomplishment for the team and the team was also awarded <a href="https://roboboat.org/2020/07/26/2020-roboboat-final-standings/">$2,000</a> for coming in 2nd place! As we all know 2020 was a year where social distancing took place, so here are some photos of the ULL 2020 Team before COVID took a turn on everyones life and this was the last time the ASV was out on the water before the 2020 RoboBoat Competition.</p>

<p>In August of 2020, a group of 4 undergrads took on the challenge of improving upon the ULL RoboBoat system yet again. The team decided to change the approach used last semester and decided to figure out what would be the most beneficial to upgrade in this system. What the team determined was in order to improve the system, the best place to look would be at maximizing the points this system can obtain. After looking at pervious competitions, the results showed that it would be best to add a UAV to the system due to the points the team could obtian from launching and landing on the ASV, as well as using the UAV for the object delivery task. With the UAV being added to the system, the thought is that there is a potential to add around 1200 points to the total points that the ULL RoboBoat Team can obtain.</p>

<p><a><img style="float: left;" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51193887202_521475a42e_o.png" height="265" alt="51194800123_08104afebc_o" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From there the team dived into reasearch on the different possibilities for the UAV in this competiton. These possiblities included Drones, VTOLs, Blimps, and Ballons. The final design choice was a Drone due to its versatility and size. The team had to meet certain <a href="https://robonation.org/app/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/RoboBoat-2021-Rules-and-Task-Description_V2.pdf">design specifications</a> and a few to note were the UAV must be autonomous, positively buoyant, and there must be a kill switch. This led to the creation of the UAV located on the left. The Team decided that the main body would be of DJIâ€™s F450 Frame, but to save on weight the top and bottom plates would be custom made out of carbon fiber to save on weight and add veratility to the system. The main customization occured with the enclosures, which were 3-D printed out of PLA and ABS to ensure that the electronics would be in enclosures rated IP 34. Also, to allow for the UAV to be positively buoyant, the team 3-D printed fasteners that would lock onto backer rod, which was determined to allow the UAV to float in the water though density calculations. To allow the UAV to be autonomous, the team opted into using the Pixhawk 4 autopilot controller to send and recive data through QGround Control. Since this team opted into using the Pixhawk 4, there became a way for the team to use ROS in this system, specially through the use of <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/mavlink">MAVLink</a>, and since the team was able to use QGround Control, the kill switch could easily be mapped to the RC Controller.</p>

<br /></p>

<p>As the UAV was being built, there were improvements being made to the ASV. First and foremost, the new electronics enclosure needed to be mounted to the ASV. So, some of the team took a weekend to cut all of the necessary fittings and install the enclosure onto the ASV. Once the new enclosure was mounted, all of the old electronics needed to be transferred from the old enclosure to the new enclosure. After that task was completed, the team decided to change all of its ZED stereo cameras for the new <a href="https://store.opencv.ai/products/oak-d">OAK-D</a> cameras that were obtained through the <a href="https://opencv.org/opencv-ai-competition-2021/">OAK-D comeptetion</a>. Once the two cameras were installed on the bow and stern of the ASV, the next thing to install was the Hokuyo Scanning Rangefinder on the stern ASV. the results of the installation can be seen below.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>Once all of the components were installed, the system was now ready to test. This test occured at a local swamp and the progress of the system can be shown in the videos below. These videos show that the ASV is able to move around with all of the new improvements and the UAV is able to move around as well. Durring this testing the ASV and UAV were both being controlled through a remote.</p>

<p>This is as far as the team was able to progress until a drastic turn occuredâ€¦ one of the ASVâ€™sthrusters hit the hull during a small impact, which cracked the fiberglass. Unfortunately the team is currently at a standstill until this solution gets fixed, but maybe this is a time for an improvement in the hull of the system? Maybe the next team can patch up the hull and continue to dive into creating a better 
autonomous system? Tune in next year for future details as the content on this page will be updated when the next team ULL RoboBoat decides to take on this new challengeâ€¦.</p>
