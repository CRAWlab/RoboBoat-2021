# Long-term planning
 As a team we would like to be able to have the success of this project defined in the next few weeks. We want to have the final design concept decided by mid October. We would like to have the drone flying autonomously with a camera attached to the bottom of it within a pre-defined area by the begging of next semester. We want to fully test this design by late February, early March to have time to correct the flaws in the coding and design. We are looking to have the UAV fly autonomously with a camera attached to it, map the course, raise/deliver an object, and have the UAV integrated with ASV by the end of next semester.
