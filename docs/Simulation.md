## 2021 UL Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns Simulation

- Should tabs be made for UAV, ASV, Blender, Labelbox?

- First thing on this page will be a clip of a video of the UAV moving in simulation
- Next we can talk about the design process in this simulation and how the UAV was made to work in [RotorS](http://wiki.ros.org/rotors_simulator)
    - We can show of how this UAV failed many times and we can talk about why it failed and how we worked to fix this issue
    - Show clips of failures and then a successful launch
    
*Coming soon...*
