# Integration of a UAV to the RoboBoat to aid in task completion and navigation

## Long-term Project Goal
Integrate a UAV to the RoboBoat to increase the points gained while completing certain tasks and aid in navigating the courses more efficiently.

> ***JV*** Does it have to be a drone?
> ***JS*** No sir, this was an oversight on our part. The Long-term Poject Goal has not been looked at or update since we started these reports. Both sections now reflect 'UAV'.

## Short-term Goal
To complete a working final draft of design tools and continuously update Gantt chart.

## Recent Results Overview

1. As a team, we went back through the design tools with a more general mindset. Finished working final draft of the [House of Quality](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools) **Team**

2. As a team, we went back through the design tools with a more general mindset. Finished working final draft of the [Function Tree](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools) **Team**

3. Discussed procedure for aiding the RoboBoat in navigating the course: Plan to aid the ASV by capturing a data set of each task and communicating the information to the ASV as opposed to capturing the entire course. We are planning to be a task ahead of the ASV. Two ideas that we are thinking about are recognizing the color of the buoys or detecting geometry of the tasks layout(convex hull/cluster analysis). **Team**

4. Detailed review into previous UAV tasks: Last 3 years there was an object delivery that was accomplished by using a UAV. Max weight of each object to be delivered was the average weight of a racquetball, 40g. Minimum weight of object to be delivered was the average weight of a pingpong ball, 2.7g. The actual maximum was 4 times each average because each team could carry 4 objects. **Team**

## Plan for the next two weeks
1. We are still waiting to register with RoboNation.
2. Determine the "best" solutions for our product sub-functions by completing a morphological chart.
3. Begin compiling an Evaluation Matrix.
4. Working final drafts of design tools completed.
5. Midterm presentation for Dr. Simon (10min 6-10 slides) for next week

> ***JV*** If you'd like me to take a quick look at your slides and/or have questions about presenting on design, please let me know.
> ***JS*** I think that would be helpful. We weren't really given much guidance as to what Dr. Simon is expecting. He just said an update on what we've done so far. As soon as we have the first draft we will send it over. Thank you

6. Begin compiling Final Presentation


### What are your next steps?
1. I (Brennan) plan to continue diving into ROS. I have some Udemy courses that I can leverage to learn ROS basics. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle. Joseph and I will work on getting the electronic mount CAD ready for the enclosure.   

2. I (Nathan) plan to work on an online course which will include learning the basic control of a drone, drone exploration, and drone navigation. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle.

3. I (Ben) plan to get into understanding the basics of ROS and I will be helping out wherever I am needed. I (as well as the rest of the team) will also be working on adding more to the Specification Sheet, morphological chart, and the Evaluation Matrix. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle.

4. I (Joseph) will be starting with the programming drones with ROS course. I am also going to go through this tutorial on ArUco markers being used in ROS to estimate the ArUco markers 6 DOF pose: [ArUco Marker Tutorial](http://ros-developer.com/2017/04/23/aruco-ros/) Brenna and I will work on getting the electronic mount CAD ready for the enclosure.

> ***JV*** As we discussed on the call this week, you can also use the TurtleBot and the Husky. The small robot I left is just another alternative. I would also be comfortable working in gazebo.


### What work do you expect to have done by next report? What results to you expect?
By next report, we plan to have a finished first draft of the specification sheet, a morphological chart, and a working draft of an Evaluation Matrix with the "best" design for this application determined.

### Are we on schedule with respect to the GitHub Project and/or Gantt Chart?
No we are not on schedule for this semester, but we are working diligently to catch up and get back on pace.

# Long-term planning
We want to have the final design concept decided by last week of October. We would like to have the UAV flying autonomously with a camera attached to the bottom of it within a pre-defined area by the begging of next semester. We want to fully test this design by late February, early March to have time to correct the flaws in the coding and design. We are looking to have the UAV fly autonomously with a camera attached to it, collect data that represents objects, raise/deliver an object, and have the UAV integrated with ASV by the end of next semester.

## Up coming Paper Deadlines
Senior projects progress report due every other Thursday starting September 16, 2020.
Midterm Presentations due Thursday October 22nd.
Final Team Presentations: due dates range from November 9th - November 16th. We need to have something prepared by Monday November 9th.
Final Reports due Friday November 20th.

> ***JV*** Final report? Presentations?

> ***JS*** Updated, thank you.

## Administrative Deadlines
None yet. Waiting on rules form RoboNation to be released.
