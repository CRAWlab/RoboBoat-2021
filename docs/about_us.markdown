  <h1 style="text-align:center;"> History of UL Lafayette Ragin' Cajun RoboBoat Team </h1>

This year is the third year that ULL has participated in the RoboBoat Competition. The first year ULL competed was in 2019. This team was composed of a senior projects team and Dr. Vaughan. The senior projects team had focused up on created the ASV from scratch and they also made the ASV autonomous. This autonomous system was very basic and had a lot of room to improve upon. The 2020 team decided to improve the autonomous system. The 2020 team was composed of a few graduate students, undergraduate students, and Dr. Vaughan. The 2020 team was unable to test the new research that had taken place due to COVID-19 restrictions, but they left a great base for the 2021 team to improve.

The ULL teams that have taken place for this RoboBoat Competition have all been under the [CRAWLab](https://userweb.ucs.louisiana.edu/
~jev9637/). The CRAWLab has allowed students to take apart in research opportunities in controls as well as robotics. Dr. Vaughan is 
in charge of this lab and he has played a large role in helping students understand more about controls and autonomous systems. He is also 
the original faculty advisor for the ULL Ragin' Cajun RoboBoat team. This year a few changes were made to this years team. Two new undergrads were placed into this years competition and Ms. Qudsi was chosen to be a faculty advisor along with Dr. Vaughan. The team for the 2021 
competition was mainly a group of undergrads, who were looking for a senior design project and as two of the four undergrads had been apart 
of the ULL Ragin' Cajun  RoboBoat 2020 team, the team decided to take this competition on as their senior project. There was a lot the team had to figure out and develop, but this website reflects our accomplishments and we do hope that you all enjoy seeing our progress and future development in the  RoboBoat Competition.
