## Senior Projects Meeting Notes 8/20/2020
### Contributions made by: Nathan Madsen, Brennan Moeller, Joseph Stevens, Benjamin Willis


**Possible Project Ideas**
1. Controls of Boat
	* Corelation b/w Camera and laser 
	* High level control algorithms - learning about state machines
	* Working on control allocation
2. Drone
	* Coordination w/drone or aerial vehicle(could be tethered)
		* [Drone 1 link](https://shop.holybro.com/px4-vision_p1225.html)
		* [Drone 2 link](https://shop.holybro.com/x500-kit_p1180.html)
3. Upgrade to the electronics
	* Raspberrie pie "HAT". This is a all in one control unit.
		* ["HAT"](https://navio2.emlid.com/)
4. Multiple Bridges
	* Possibility of having multiple bridges for different course objectives
	* This may include having two electronics enclosures

**Plan of Action**
1. Have S.M.A.R.T goals, "specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time"
2. Spec sheet - improve navigation
	* navigate @ this speed
	* sense obstacles @ this distance
3. Double check with Dr. Simon to see if he got Dr. Vaughan's email
4. Any option will most likely also include mounting the new enclosure and neatly organizing all electronics components inside. Also, mounting the new camera and laser.
5. Could walk around first floor of Rougeau for mapping as a demonstration of what the camera vision and lydar system can do
6. Use laser to correlate how far objects are away from boat.
7. Need to look through past reports. Dr. Vaughan mentioned Mexico and Florida
8. Make a strong case for what we need as far as a budget is concerned.
9. Will need to complete design tools: House of Quality, Spec Sheet etc.
