# Integration of a UAV to the RoboBoat to aid in task completion and navigation

## Long-term Project Goal

Integrate a rotary UAV to the RoboBoat to increase the points gained while completing certain tasks and aid in navigating the courses more efficiently.

## Short-term Goal

To complete a working final draft of the Evaluation Matrix, work on final report and presentation. 

## Recent Results Overview

1. As a team, we went back through the [Specification Sheet, House of Quality, and Function tree](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools) and have updated the comments that were given to us and continued to iterate these tools. **Team**

2. As a team, we have created a [Morphological Chart](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools). It is a working document because we are still evaluating possible solutions for each of the lower-level functions that must be completed. **Team**

3. Discussed procedure for aiding the RoboBoat in navigating the course: Plan to aid the ASV by capturing a data set of each task and communicating the information to the ASV as opposed to capturing the entire course. We are planning to be a task ahead of the ASV. We plan to use the GPS coordinates provided by RoboBoat to deploy the UAV in the general direction of the next "Task". Following deployment, two ideas were discussed; recognizing the color of the buoys, or detecting geometry of the tasks layout(convex hull/cluster analysis). Afterwards, the UAV could work as a "pin" for the boat to find; given that the ASV will know its approximate relative position to the UAV and its approximate global position. The development of these ideas continue to advance while working through the design tools, but are not final. **Team**

4. The old enclosure is completely taken apart and the individual parts are labeled. The design of the enclosure mount has not been determined. 

5. Battery chargers have been selected based on overall reviews from hobbyist that have used them. [Battery Chargers  Comparison Sheet](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools) 

## Questions/Comments

1. Do we want to avoid re-designing the individual mounts that were created for the electronics? 


## Plan for the next two weeks

1. Revise working final drafts of design tools
2. Continue compiling a Morphological Chart
3. Figure out how to ssh into the Stingray over Wifi
4. Begin compiling Final Presentation charts and graphs and start the final paper
6. We are still waiting to completely register with RoboNation

### What are your next steps?

#### As a team

1. Finish revisions of current design tools
2. Work on final report (Finish outline and work on abstract and introduction)
3. Finish the morphological chart and submit for review
4. Finish the evaluation matrix and submit for review
5. Use the design tools to come to a conclusion for the final UAV design
6. Write and submit proposal for UAV

#### Individually

1. I (Brennan) plan to continue diving into ROS. I have some Udemy courses that I can leverage to learn ROS basics. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team. Work on finalizing the electronics mount and helping on the design tools and final report and presentation as needed.

2. I (Nathan) plan to work on an online course which will include learning the basic control of a drone, drone exploration, and drone navigation. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle.

3. I (Ben) plan to get into understanding the basics of ROS and I will be helping out wherever I am needed. I (as well as the rest of the team) will also be working on adding more to the Specification Sheet, morphological chart, and the Evaluation Matrix. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle.

4. I (Joseph) will be working mainly focusing on getting the design tools to a point that enables us to come to a conclusion on our final UAV design. Also, my attention will be on our final report and presentation.


### What work do you expect to have done by next report? What results to you expect?

By next report, we expect to have all design tools completed and a final UAV design determined.

### Are we on schedule with respect to the GitHub Project and/or Gantt Chart?

No we are not on schedule for this semester, but we are working diligently to catch up and get back on pace.

# Long-term planning

**We want to have the final design concept decided by the  week of November 9th. We would like to have the UAV flying autonomously with a camera attached to the bottom of it within a pre-defined area by the begging of next semester. We want to fully test this design by late February, early March to have time to correct the flaws in the coding and design. We are looking to have the UAV fly autonomously with a camera attached to it, collect data that represents objects, raise/deliver an object, and have the UAV integrated with ASV by the end of next semester.**   ??????
