## 2021 UL Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns Journey
- Here we will show off the main progress of the progress on this project, what it entailed, what it is really just all about. For Instance:

## Navigating the Pond

- Here is where we can show it moving in video in the pond
- Also, here is where we can bring up why the [2019 ULL Team](https://userweb.ucs.louisiana.edu/~jev9637/research/RoboBoat_2019.html) created the boat to be in holonomic motion. 

<!-- There will need to be a vimeo account set up for videos to take place -->
<!-- Dont Worry Brennan. I kept everything you had written before right here



## 2021 UL Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns ASV
  
  - The ASV for the 2021 competition is an improved version of the previous system. The computer aided design can be seen below following the cad is the current state of the ASV.

</p>

   - This ASV was custom fabricated at UL Lafayette in 2019. It uses four Blue Robotics T-200 thrusters in an unique X configuration to allow holonomic motion. For perception, it has an Oak-D machine vision sensor and a Hokuyo LiDAR on both the bow and stern. This system has two NVIDIA Jetson TX2s for the heavy computation and a Raspberry Pi 4 with an EMLID NAVIO2 control HAT to aid in motor control and various sensing capabilities.

## The New Enclosure
* The cad files for the new enclosure was used to create new mounting brackets for this enclosure. 8020 T-Slotted frame was used because of its adaptability and ease of assembly.

## The New Electronics 

- The new electronics enclosure utilizes DIN-Rail to create easy mounting and arranging of the internal computers, sensors, and other electronics used in operation of the multi-agent system.
