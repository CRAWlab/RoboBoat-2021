# Meeting Minutes from 9/17/2020

 1) Field of View 
	* Can calculate directly from center of camera. 
	* H = height, V = vertical, D = diagonal 
	* Coordinates as they relate to the field of view should be thought of as a sphere
	* Could do basic trig calculations using distance to get a better idea of the dimensions that could be captured at a defined distance. 

2) Camera Calibration 
	* QR codes and April tags are used for this specifically and would be a good area of research

3) Mapping 
	* Planer map could be G-mapping 
	* Research - How do we draw the map
	* Research - How do we figure out where the UAV is relative to the map, where the ASV is relative to the map, and where both are relative to each other.
	* Research -  S.L.A.M. algorithms that can be used in ROS

4) Other research to be done for UAV
	* Rasberry pie hat look into tutorials for this
	* Research possible other distance sensing tools besides cameras
	* Research and begin practicing how to use MAVROS 
5) Competition
	* Will have a test day or two, first test run or day will most likely be able to use remote control, then fully autonomous from that point on throughout competition.
	* Will be able to remote control vehicle to up to beginning of course - distance determined by the judges.
