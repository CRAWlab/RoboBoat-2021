The goal for this years competiton was to incorporate a mobile sensor with the ASV to help out with path planning. The mobile sensor 
    would be used to take in data of the buoys from a fixed distance and send the results to the ASV. The ASV would then take in that data 
    and run its designated algorthm so that the distacnes of the buoys from one to the other would be able to be determined. Once the 
    determination on the distances of the buoys has been made, the ASV would be able to travel through the buoys as quickly as possible. This 
    allows for the ASV to gain more points in the process as it would have the tendency to move around faster that it would have before. Also,
    the mobile sensor would be outfitted with an object obtaining device so that it would be able to pick up and drop off objects for the object
    delivery task.
