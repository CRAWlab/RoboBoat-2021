## 2021 UL Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns UAV Simulation

- Insert a clip: UAV moving in simulation

### The Basics

- This UAV was created in simulation to show the comparison of how the UAV will act in simulation verus in the real world. The simulation that was used in this experiment was based off from [RotorS](http://wiki.ros.org/rotors_simulator), which was developed by the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). The perk of using [RotorS](http://wiki.ros.org/rotors_simulator) for this experiment is due to it being a MAV gazebo simulator. 
    - Gazebo simulator is useful in adding real world forces to the simulation. This helps with making sure that the UAV will be able to counteract these forces as well as move like it should be.

### Other topics:

- We can show of how this UAV failed many times and we can talk about why it failed and how we worked to fix this issue
- Show clips of failures and then a successful launch
