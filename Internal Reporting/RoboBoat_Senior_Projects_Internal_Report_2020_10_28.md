# Integration of a UAV to the RoboBoat to aid in task completion and navigation

## Long-term Project Goal

Integrate a rotary UAV to the RoboBoat to increase the points gained while completing certain tasks and aid in navigating the courses more efficiently.

## Short-term Goal

To complete a working final draft of design tools and continuously update Gantt chart.

## Recent Results Overview

1. As a team, we went back through the [Specification Sheet, House of Quality, and Function tree](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools) and have updated the comments that were given to us. For the Function Tree we have went back through it a little bit, but are waiting to discuss this in our weekly meeting on Thursdays. **Team**

2. As a team, we have created a [Morphological Chart](http://crawlab.org/owncloud/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2Fshared%2FRoboBoat%2FRoboBoat2021%2FSeniorProjects_Design_Tools). It is a working document because we have had to go back through our design tools to make sure we are understanding the requirements needed by a final design. **Team**

3. Discussed procedure for aiding the RoboBoat in navigating the course: Plan to aid the ASV by capturing a data set of each task and communicating the information to the ASV as opposed to capturing the entire course. We are planning to be a task ahead of the ASV. Two ideas that we are thinking about are recognizing the color of the buoys or detecting geometry of the tasks layout(convex hull/cluster analysis). This was further discussed, and we are unsure of the exact way that this needs to be done. We are possibly thinking that the UAV will work as a "pin" for the boat to find; given that the ASV knows its relative position to the UAV and its position globally. ***(I don't know if this is the way we want to put it.???)***     **Team**

4. We are close to being finished breaking down the old enclosure. The old enclosure was taken off of the boat and CAD model for the new mounting plate was started. The lay out of the electronics needs to be discussed and finalized. **Team**

## Plan for the next two weeks

1. We are still waiting to register with RoboNation
2. Working final drafts of design tools are being revised
3. Continue compiling a Morphological chart
4. Figure out how to ssh into the Stingray over Wifi
5. Begin compiling Final Presentation charts and graphs and start outlining the final paper


### What are your next steps?

1. I (Brennan) plan to continue diving into ROS. I have some Udemy courses that I can leverage to learn ROS basics. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team. Work on finalizing the electronics mount.

2. I (Nathan) plan to work on an online course which will include learning the basic control of a drone, drone exploration, and drone navigation. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle.

3. I (Ben) plan to get into understanding the basics of ROS and I will be helping out wherever I am needed. I (as well as the rest of the team) will also be working on adding more to the Specification Sheet, morphological chart, and the Evaluation Matrix. Work with the robot that Dr. Vaughan left with the team and Kyle.

4. I (Joseph) will be starting with the programming drones with ROS course. I am also going to go through this tutorial on ArUco markers being used in ROS to estimate the ArUco markers 6 DOF pose: [ArUco Marker Tutorial](http://ros-developer.com/2017/04/23/aruco-ros/) Brenna and I will work on getting the electronic mount CAD ready for the enclosure.



### What work do you expect to have done by next report? What results to you expect?

By next report, 

### Are we on schedule with respect to the GitHub Project and/or Gantt Chart?

No we are not on schedule for this semester, but we are working diligently to catch up and get back on pace.

# Long-term planning

We want to have the final design concept decided by last week of October. We would like to have the UAV flying autonomously with a camera attached to the bottom of it within a pre-defined area by the begging of next semester. We want to fully test this design by late February, early March to have time to correct the flaws in the coding and design. We are looking to have the UAV fly autonomously with a camera attached to it, collect data that represents objects, raise/deliver an object, and have the UAV integrated with ASV by the end of next semester.

## Up coming Paper Deadlines

1. Senior projects progress report due every other Thursday starting September 16, 2020
2. Final Team Presentations: due dates range from November 9th - November 16th
3. Final Report is due Friday November 20th by 12:00PM
4. We need to have a final presentation prepared by Friday November, 13th to present to the Lab in our weekly meeting



## Administrative Deadlines

None yet. Waiting on rules form RoboNation to be released.
