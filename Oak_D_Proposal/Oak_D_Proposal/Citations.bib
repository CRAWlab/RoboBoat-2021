The first group includes exact and inexact Newton and Newton--Kantorovich implementations of the sequen- tial quadratic programming. In the second group, exact and inexact Newton and Newton--Kantorovich methods are developed for solving a nonsmooth normal map equation equivalent to the optimality system.

	Abstract = {We present shrinking horizon model predictive con- trol for discrete-time linear systems under stochastic disturbances with constraints encoded as signal temporal logic (STL) specifica- tion. The control objective is to satisfy a given STL specification with high probability against stochastic uncertainties while maxi- mizing the robust satisfaction of an STL specification with minimum control effort. We formulate a general solution, which does not re- quire precise knowledge of probability distributions of (possibly de- pendent) stochastic disturbances; only the bounded support of the density functions and moment intervals are used. For the specific case of disturbances that are normally distributed, we optimize the controllers by utilizing knowledge of the probability distribution of the disturbance. We show that in both cases, the control law can be obtained by solving optimization problems with linear constraints at each step. We experimentally demonstrate effectiveness of this approach by synthesizing a controller for a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system.},

	Abstract = {The path-following (PF) problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is studied, in which the path conver- gence is viewed as the main task while the speed profile is also taken into consideration as a secondary task. To accommodate the prioritized PF tasks, a novel multiobjective model predictive control (MPC) (MOMPC) framework is developed. Two methods, namely, weighted sum (WS) and lexicographic ordering, are investigated for solving the MOMPC PF problem. A logistic function is proposed for the WS method in an attempt to automatically select the appropriate weights. The Pontryagin minimum principle is subsequently applied for the WS-MOMPC implementation. The implicit relation between the two methods is shown, and the convergence of the solution with the MOMPC PF control algorithms is analyzed. Simulation studies on the Saab SeaEye Falcon AUV demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MOMPC PF control.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a continuous-time constrained control strategy which mimics the behavior of a traditional model predictive control scheme using dynamic feedback. The approach is based on the idea that the solution of the optimal control problem can be embedded in the internal states of a dynamic control law running in parallel to the system. Using input to state stability arguments, it is shown that if the controller dynamics are sufficiently fast with respect to the plant dynamics, the interconnection between the two systems is asymptotically stable. Additionally, it is shown that, by augmenting the proposed scheme with an add-on unit known as an Explicit Reference Governor, it is possible to guarantee recursive feasibility and limit the residual of the optimal control problem, regardless of any changes in the desired set-point. Numerical examples featuring aerospace applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

	Annote = {Main challenge is loss of recursive feasibility and stability guarantees when persistent disturbance is present in the model

Robust stability and feasibility are established under assumption that disturbance change across sampling instances is limited

[1] has information on theoretical foundations of stability and robustness of MPCs

Nominal MPC for deterministic (disturbance-free) systems, robust MPC for bounded uncertainty, stochastic MPC for systems subject to uncertainties with a probabalistic description is available

Necessary and sufficient conditions for inherent robustness properties of nominal MPC are well-established [5,6]

Piecewise [7-9] and periodic [10-12] disturbances signals have been investigated in regulation of a disturbed system with nominal MPC
--- [15-17] discuss this preview control problem for wind energy

Objective of this paper is to study direct use of a disturbance prediction within a nominal MPC formulation for regulatinon, develop conditions for recursive feasility, stability, and inherent robustness without using the well-known techniques fromt racking or resorting to a robust or stochastic approach.
--- Consider an LTI, constrained system subject to additive disturbance
--- Future disturbances over the prediction horizon is known at the current time, but, the sequence may change arbitrarily (within a bounded set) at the next step, and is thus, persistent.

Contributions:
1) Modified standard terminal ingredients for nominal MPC [21] to account for the disturbance appearing in the prediction model
2) Consider a general form of terminal conditions permitting the use of nonlinear terminal control law

Using these, the ill-posedness of the optimal control problem is removed, and desirable properties of invariance of the terminal set and monotonic descent of terminal cost hold for the peturbed model

3) Inherent robustness to changing preview information of the controlled system, and find that the system states converge to a robust positively invariant set around the origin, the size of which depends on the limit assumed or imposed on the step-to-step change of the disturbance predictions.

Including disturbances in the prediction model increases region of attraction for controllers that omit the disturbance information

QUESTION: Is a terminal penalty necessary for error-based MPC as opposed to state-based MPC?

Disturbance sequence used in the next step is not necessarily the tail of the previous solution --- similar to mine ---> I ALWAYS adjust the future wind speeds based on the standard deviations

See [21] for standard conditions to design the cost and terminal set to reach, stabilizing MPC

QUESTION: I don't understand Assumption 6. The minimum of the terminal cost as a function of the LTI system and the stage cost is less than the terminal cost?

QUESTION: Do these issues that arise from including disturbance in the LTI class systems also occur when done on a nonlinear system?

Terminal = Beyond the Horizon 

Terminal disturbances assumed to be constant, but can change from time step to time step

Disturbances after the prediction horizon are assumed to be constant of magnitude of the last value in the prediction horizon.

Uses Beta_x and Beta_u as scaling factors to scale the constraint sets (Beta_x X, Beta_u U) to account for the effect of the nonzero disturbances on the terminal dynamics

Linearized the system about the equilibrium point x = 0, assuming that Kf(.) is continuous over the terminal region, Kf(0) = 0, and is continuously differentiable about x = 0

QUESTION: How does having an invertible/positive definite matrix PSI make the linearized system stable? Is it because of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system from this matrix?

Cost function is translated to new equilibrium point and used in the optimal control problem

When is optimal control problem feasible, given that the disturbance sequence may have changed, perhaps arbitrarily, from w to w+?

QUESTION: What is exponential stability?

QUESTION: Even if we can show stability of the controller with bounded disturbance rates of change, is this still true if we also apply an actuator rate limit?

	Abstract = {Disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) and related methods have been researched and applied in various industrial sectors in the last four decades. This survey, at first time, gives a systematic and comprehen- sive tutorial and summary on the existing disturbance/ uncertainty estimation and attenuation techniques, most notably, DOBC, active disturbance rejection control, distur- bance accommodation control, and composite hierarchical antidisturbance control. In all of these methods, distur- bance and uncertainty are, in general, lumped together, and an observation mechanism is employed to estimate the total disturbance. This paper first reviews a number of widely used linear and nonlinear disturbance/uncertainty estimation techniques and then discusses and compares various compensation techniques and the procedures of integrating disturbance/uncertainty compensation with a (predesigned) linear/nonlinear controller. It also provides concise tutorials of the main methods in this area with clear descriptions of their features. The application of this group of methods in various industrial sections is reviewed, with emphasis on the commercialization of some algo- rithms. The survey is ended with the discussion of future directions.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a stable model predictive control method for discrete-time nonlinear systems. The standard MPC scheme is modified to incorporate (1) a block implementation scheme where a sub-string of the optimized input sequence is applied instead of a single value; (2) an additional constraint which guarantees that a Lyapunov function will decrease over time; (3) a variable implementation window that facilitates the stability constraint enforcement. Stability of the closed-loop system with the proposed algorithm is established. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the control scheme. The impacts of several key design parameters on the overall performance are also analyzed and discussed.},
	Annote = {Stability for MPC schemes is seen as a fundamental problem. Solutions to guarantee stability are increase the prediction horizon or incorporate a proper penalty and/or to impose certain constraints on the final state at end of the horizon.

Michalska and Mayne, 1993 propose MPC to steer trajectory into a terminal set inside which the control is switched to a lcoal stabilizing controller.

``Block MPC'' uses a string or subsequence of the control instead of just applying the first element. An additional contractive constraint is also enforced to guarantee that a Lyapunov-like function decreases over time. Allowing the size of the string, the ``implementation window'', to vary, the ability to enforce the constraints is greatly enhanced.

Alamir, 2006 proposes another contractive NMPC approach, which includes horizon as optimization variable. Due to reformulation of cost function, this avoid explicit use of contraction stability constraint.

Block MPC requires less computing demand since you can solve the optimization problem in Nc time steps intead of 1.

Proved that constraint (3) is enforced in both optimization and in control implementation and execution. Does this by selecting the proper implementation window size.

The implementation window is a design parameter that is exploited to enhance the feasibility condition and acheive a good trade-off between computational expense and disturbance rejection.

Don't understand how case 4 represents a stable response in Figure 1.

Given a positive definite function V, constraint (3) is not enforcable at each sampling instant (0, Nc, 2Nc, 3Nc, {\ldots}). Recursive feasibility, feasibility preserved under state evolution, is not guranteed, even if the initial problem is feasible.

Definition 3.2 expands the V-contractible region to cover the admissible set for the states x. By allowing the implementation window size to vary between 1 and Nc, the admissible set for the states x is always bigger than the fixed-step contractible region.
- Contractibility of V is defined by function V and the system

Constraint (3) is a special case of (11), where alpha = 0 at zero, but is positive elsewhere. Complete controllability of discrete-time systems depends on time interval being sufficiently large; therfore, (11) may also not be enforced at each sampling instance (0, Nc, 2Nc, 3Nc, {\ldots}), butenforcing (11) instead of (3) can offer additional flexibility due to choice of alpha.

	Abstract = {The usual way to guarantee stability of model predictive control (MPC) strategies is based on a terminal cost function and a terminal constraint region. This note analyzes the stability of MPC when the terminal constraint is removed. This is particularly interesting when the system is unconstrained on the state. In this case, the computational burden of the optimization problem does not have to be increased by introducing terminal state constraints due to stabilizing reasons. A region in which the terminal constraint can be removed from the optimization problem is characterized depending on some of the design parameters of MPC. This region is a domain of attraction of the MPC without terminal constraint. Based on this result, it is proved that weighting the terminal cost, this domain of attraction of the MPC controller without terminal constraint is enlarged reaching (practically) the same domain of attraction of the MPC with terminal constraint; moreover, a practical procedure to calculate the stabilizing weighting factor for a given initial state is shown. Finally, these results are extended to the case of suboptimal solutions and an asymptotically stabilizing suboptimal controller without terminal constraint is presented.},
	Annote = {No terminal cost makes MPC more like LQR

ROA is the set of initial states from which the system converges to the equilibrium point
--- System should be asymptotically stable everywhere because of drag forces, if I'm understanding this correctly.

Finite horizon nominal MPC optimization problem with terminal cost and terminal constraint is standard way of formulating MPC controller [1] --- general MPC

Terminal cost and constraint are generally chosen to satisfy equations 3 and 4, and is proven in [3]

Removal of terminal constraint, like in [4-7], can make the problem much easier to solve, but reduces the domain of attraction.

[5] shows that for quadratic terminal cost function ax^T P x and any stabilizable initial state, there exists (a, P, N) that the system is stabilized.

[7] indicates that domain of attraction of MPC is enlarged when prediction horizon increases
--- What effect does this have on the system response?

QUESTION: If I'm understanding this paper correctly, what is the benefit of doing what I'm proposing if you can achieve (effectively) the same result by applying some weight to the terminal cost? Is it that I can do it with a cost function without a terminal cost?

@article{Marquardt:14a,
	Abstract = {Experimental testing of an unmanned amphibious tracked vehicle on dry sand, in the surfzone and in water, has been performed to explore its maneuvering and performance characteristics for the planned future development of an auto- matic control system. The 2.69-m-long, 295-kg concept vehicle utilizes a small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) configuration with integrated crawler tracks and twin propellers for propulsion. Maximum traversable incline tests on dry sand reveal that the vehicle has a drawbar pull (DP) of about 1000 N (about one third of its weight) and can operate on slopes of 15 briefly and 10 for extended periods of time. Maneuvering tests were performed on flat, dry sand, as well as into and out of a surfzone at a beach site with inclines ranging from about 3 to 6 . In each of the tests, the track forces, speed over ground, and both linear and rotational accelerations were measured. Also recorded were environmental conditions, such as wind speed, significant waveheight/period, and ground slope. The tests reveal that the vehicle has a maximum straight-line flat ground speed of about 2 m/s, a minimum flat ground turning radius of 2.4 m, an in-water minimum turning radius of 1.9 m, and a maximum straight-line waterborne speed of 1.2 m/s. It is also shown that system identification applied to the data recorded from the flat ground and waterborne maneuvering tests can be used to find a linear, parametric state--space model for the vehicle that adequately reproduces its motion. Land-to-sea transition tests in two different seas of one-third significant wave- heights of 8 and 28 cm (both measured at a distance of 6 m from the mean waterline on the beach) show that the vehicle exhibits substantial track slip as it traverses into the surfzone and its weight becomes increasingly supported by the displacement of its hulls. The tractive force model developed by Wong (Theory of Ground Vehicles, New York, NY, USA: Wiley, 2001) is modified to account for the reduction in track-supported vehicle weight as the vehicle becomes waterborne. It is shown that this adapted model captures the main physical features of the measured track forces. The waveheights and periods recorded during surfzone transition tests are used to examine the seakeeping properties of the vehicle. It is found that the vehicle's natural frequency of roll is near the dominant wave frequencies measured. A Froude--Krylov strip theory simulation shows that the wave forces acting on the vehicle in 28-cm waves may be slightly larger than the force measured on each track when the DUKW-Ling is crossing the transition zone between the beach and surfzone and should not be ignored in modeling and simulation studies.},

	Abstract = {The availability of adequate system models to reproduce, as faithfully as possible, the actual behaviour of the experimental systems is of key importance. In marine systems, the changing environmental conditions and the complexity of the infrastructure needed to carry out experimental tests call for mathematical models for accurate simulations. There exist a wide number of techniques to define mathematical models from experimental data. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have shown a great performance in pattern recognition and classification research areas having an inherent potential ability for linear and nonlinear system identification. In this paper, this ability is demonstrated through the identification of the Nomoto second-order ship model with real experimental data obtained from a zig-zag manoeuvre made by a scale ship. The mathematical model of the ship is identified using Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) for regression by analysing the rudder angle, surge and sway speed, and yaw rate. The coefficients of the Nomoto model are obtained with a linear kernel function. The model obtained is validated through experimental tests that illustrate the potential of SVM for system identification.},

	Abstract = {The motion of marine vessels has traditionally been studied using two different approaches: manoeuvring and seakeeping. These two approaches use different reference frames and coordinate systems to describe the motion. This paper derives the kinematic models that characterize the transformation of motion variables (position, velocity, accelerations) and forces between the different coordinate systems used in these theories. The derivations hereby presented are done in terms of the formalism adopted in robotics. The advantage of this formulation is the use of matrix notation and operations. As an application, the transformation of linear equations of motion used in seakeeping into body-fixed coordinates is considered for both zero and forward speed.},

	Abstract = {The performance of four automatically-generated path planning behaviors is evaluated through field- testing. Experiments were conducted using a model-referenced trajectory planner, which was implemen- ted on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) of different size, thrust, and maneuverability characteristics. The planner combines a local search based on the Velocity Obstacles (VO) concept with a global, lattice-based search for a dynamically feasible trajectory (determined using models of the nonlinear dynamics, nonholonomic constraints, and low-level control of each system). Multiple low-level USV heading and speed controllers, varying in complexity from proportional control to nonlinear backstepping control, were tested with the planner. High planning performance is achieved by searching within a resolution-adaptive space of the USV's candidate motion goals. Sampling is constrained to ensure that the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) are followed. Prior to on-water implementa- tion, the system was fine-tuned in simulation. Four automatically-generated USV behaviors were demonstrated in on-water tests within a complex, static obstacle field: 1) Approach (USV approaches a fixed target); 2) Follow (USV approaches a moving target); 3) Single COLREGs-Compliant Crossing (USV approaches a fixed target while avoiding another vessel); and 4) Multiple COLREGs-Compliant Crossings (USV approaches a fixed target while avoiding an interference vessel multiple times).},

	Abstract = {Determining parameters for a system model for marine vessels becomes more difficult as the model is made more complex. Work has been done to determine the equations of motion, but not to fully define how to estimate all of the system parameters. This work utilizes a global optimization methodology for estimating the system parameters using a genetic algorithm. The optimizer uses training data sets created from a set of ship maneuvering standards to minimize the error in the 3 degree-of-freedom equations of motion. The model has been optimized using a ``No Surge-Yaw'' model (minimal surge coupling) and a ``Full'' model (all states have coupling effects to each other) to determine how well each model can be estimated. The ``No Surge-Yaw'' model had the best results with making a working marine vessel model. The ``Full'' model was difficult to optimize due to the additional parameters that had unknown, nonlinear constraints. The ``No Surge-Yaw'' model was compared to linearized, no coupling version of the model that is commonly used. The linearized model vastly overestimated the results in sway and yaw rate motion while the ``No Surge-Yaw'' captured the expected coupling dynamics that do exist. Overall, the results of this methodology did generate a set of working marine vessel parameters for an unknown, coupled-state dynamic model.},

	Abstract = {This overview paper reviews numerical methods for solution of optimal con- trol problems in real-time, as they arise in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) as well as in moving horizon estimation (MHE). In the first part, we review numerical optimal control solution methods, focussing exclusively on a discrete time setting. We discuss several algorithmic ''building blocks'' that can be combined to a multitude of algorithms. We start by discussing the sequential and simultaneous approaches, the first leading to smaller, the second to more structured optimization problems. The two big families of Newton type opti- mization methods, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Interior Point (IP) methods, are presented, and we discuss how to exploit the optimal control structure in the solution of the linear-quadratic subproblems, where the two major alternatives are ``condensing'' and band structure exploiting approaches. The second part of the paper discusses how the algorithms can be adapted to the real-time challenge of NMPC and MHE. We recall an important sensitivity result from parametric optimization, and show that a tangential solution pre- dictor for online data can easily be generated in Newton type algorithms. We point out one important difference between SQP and IP methods: while both methods are able to generate the tangential predictor for fixed active sets, the SQP predictor even works across active set changes. We then classify many pro- posed real-time optimization approaches from the literature into the developed categories.

	Abstract = {In this paper, a nonlinear model predictive tracking (NMPT) controller for mobile robots is presented. The basic idea is to use a motion model for the vehicle and compute in real-time an optimal M-step-ahead control sequence, which minimizes the total M+1 step tracking error of the projected motion. In the presence of obstacles, the controller deviates from the reference trajectory by incorporating into the optimization obstacle-distance information from range sensors (e.g., laser scanner, ultrasound). Numerous simulations were performed and the NMPT consistently converged to the desired trajectories and followed them accurately, despite large initial errors and discontinuities in the desired velocities and orientations. The controller's performance depended strongly on parameters such as the optimization horizon M, and the cost-weights assigned to the various tracking errors. The optimization horizon regulates a trade-off between timely obstacle avoidance and tracking quality (large M) vs. consistently fast convergence (small M). The cost-weights affect tracking quality and also the shape of the path, by regulating trade-offs among position, orientation, and velocity errors. Overall, NMPT seems to offer a promising approach for advanced precision guidance applications, and deserves further investigation.},

	Abstract = {Variable Horizon Model Predictive Control (VH-MPC) is a form of predictive control that includes the horizon length as a decision variable in the constrained optimisation problem solved at each iteration. It has been recently applied to completion problems, where the system state is to be steered to a closed set in finite time. The behaviour of the system once completion has occurred is not considered part of the control problem.

This thesis is concerned with three aspects of robustness and optimality in VH-MPC completion problems. In particular, the thesis investigates robustness to well defined but unpredictable changes in system and controller parameters, robustness to bounded disturbances in the presence of certain input parameterisations to reduce computational complexity, and optimal robustness to bounded disturbances using tightened constraints. In the context of linear time invariant systems, new theoretical contributions and algorithms are developed.

Firstly, changing dynamics, constraints and control objectives are addressed by introducing the notion of feasible contingencies. A novel algorithm is proposed that introduces extra prediction variables to ensure that anticipated new control objectives are always feasible, under changed system parameters. In addition, a modified constraint tightening formulation is introduced to provide robust completion in the presence of bounded disturbances. Different contingency scenarios are presented and numerical simulations demonstrate the formulation's efficacy.

Next, complexity reduction is considered, using a form of input parameterisation known as move blocking. After introducing a new notation for move blocking, algorithms are presented for designing a move-blocked VH-MPC controller. Constraints are tightened in a novel way for robustness, whilst ensuring that guarantees of recursive feasibility and finite-time completion are preserved. Simulations are used to illustrate the effect of an example blocking scheme on computation time, closed-loop cost, control inputs and state trajectories.

Attention is now turned towards mitigating the effect of constraint tightening policies on a VH-MPC controller's region of attraction. An optimisation problem is formulated to maximise the volume of an inner approximation to the region of attraction, parameterised in terms of the tightening policy. Alternative heuristic approaches are also proposed to deal with high state dimensions. Numerical examples show that the new technique produces substantially improved regions of attraction in comparison to other proposed approaches, and greatly reduces the maximum required prediction horizon length for a given application.

Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the application of the new theory developed in this thesis to a non-trivial example system. A simplified nonlinear surface excavation machine and material model is developed for this purpose. The model is stabilised with an inner-loop controller, following which a VH-MPC controller for autonomous trajectory generation is designed using a discretised, linearised model of the stabilised system. Realistic simulated trajectories are obtained from applying the controller to the stabilised system and incorporating the ideas developed in this thesis.
These ideas improve the applicability and computational tractability of VH-MPC, for both traditional applications as well as those that go beyond the realm of vehicle man{\oe}uvring.},

	Abstract = {We propose an approach to handle long horizons in model predictive control (MPC). The approach is based on the observation that, if periodicity constraints are enforced over short-term stages, the long horizon MPC problem can be cast as a stochastic programming (SP) problem. The SP representation reveals a mechanism to construct a hierarchical MPC scheme under which a high-level (long-horizon) MPC controller provides periodic state targets to guide a low-level (short-term) MPC controller. We show that this hierarchical scheme is optimal under nominal (perfect forecast) conditions and can be extended to handle imperfect forecasts by correcting the targets in real-time. We demonstrate our concepts using a building system with stationary battery storage, where the goal is to use the battery to mitigate monthly demand charges while collecting revenue from hourly frequency regulation markets. We demonstrate that the hierarchical MPC scheme yields improved performance over standard MPC schemes because it can systematically capture long-term effects.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic legged locomotion is a challenging topic because of the lack of established control schemes which can handle aerial phases, short stance times, and high-speed leg swings. In this paper, we propose a controller combining whole-body control (WBC) and model predictive control (MPC). In our framework, MPC finds an optimal reaction force profile over a longer time horizon with a simple model, and WBC computes joint torque, position, and velocity commands based on the reaction forces computed from MPC. Unlike existing WBCs, which attempt to track commanded body trajectories, our controller is focused more on the reaction force command, which allows it to accomplish high speed dynamic locomotion with aerial phases. The newly devised WBC is integrated with MPC and tested on the Mini-Cheetah quadruped robot. To demonstrate the robustness and versatility, the controller is tested on six different gaits in a number of different environments, including outdoors and on a treadmill, reaching a top speed of 3.7 m/s.},

@conference{Erez:11a,
	Abstract = {We present a method that combines offline trajec- tory optimization and online Model Predictive Control (MPC), generating robust controllers for complex periodic behavior in domains with unilateral constraints (e.g., contact with the environment). MPC offers robust and adaptive control even in high-dimensional domains; however, the online optimization gets stuck in local minima when the domains has discontinuous dynamics. Some methods of trajectory optimization that are immune to such problems, but these are often too slow to be applied online.
In this paper, we use offline optimization to find the limit-cycle solution of an infinite-horizon average-cost optimal-control task. We then compute a local quadratic approximation of the Value function around this limit cycle. Finally, we use this quadratic approximation as the terminal cost of an online MPC.
This combination of an offline solution of the infinite-horizon problem with an online MPC controller is known as Infinite Horizon Model Predictive Control (IHMPC), and has previously been applied only to simple stabilization objectives. Here we extend IHMPC to tackle periodic tasks, and demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing hopping behavior in a simulated robot. IHMPC involves a limited computational load, and can be executed online on a standard laptop computer. The resulting behavior is extremely robust, allowing the hopper to recover from virtually any perturbation.
In real robotic domains, modeling errors are inevitable. We show how IHMPC is robust to modeling errors by altering the morphology of the robot; the same controller remains effective, even when the underlying infinite-horizon solution is no longer accurate.},

	Abstract = {
Precise manipulation of payloads is difficult with cranes. Oscillation can be induced into the lightly damped system by motion of the bridge or trolley, or from environmental disturbances. To address both sources of oscillation, a combined feedback and input shaping controller is developed. The controller is comprised of three distinct modules. A feedback module detects and compensates for positioning error; a second feedback module detects and rejects disturbances; input shaping is used in a third module to mitigate motion- induced oscillation. An accurate model of vector drive and AC induction motors, typical to large cranes, was used jointly with a deconvolution analysis technique to incorporate the nonlinear dynamics of crane actuators into the control design. The controller is implemented on a 10-ton bridge crane at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The controller achieves good positioning accuracy and significant sway reduction.},

	Abstract = {In this paper is proposed a control algorithm based on the first order sliding mode technique. The control design adds an exponential reaching law and a disturbance estimator to improve performance, achieving a reduction of the convergence time to the reference, as well as a reduction of the reaching time towards the sliding surface. Also, by compensating the estimated disturbance, it is possible to reduce the amplitude of the chattering in the control signal. As the control design is intended to be applied in mechanical systems, a velocity observer design is also proposed. Bringing together the above aspects, the proposed controller renders an improved performance over the classical first order sliding mode con- troller. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved using quadratic functions. The performance of the proposed control structure is illustrated and compared with other controllers via numerical simu- lations and real-time experiments in a mechanical system.},

	Abstract = {A highly nonlinear system controlled by a linear model predictive controller (MPC) may not exhibit a satisfactory dynamic performance. This has led to the development of a number of nonlinear MPC (NMPC) approaches that permit the use of first principles-based nonlinear models. Such models can be accurate over a wide range of operating conditions, but may be difficult to develop for many industrial cases. Moreover, an NMPC usually requires tremendous computational effort that may prohibit its on-line applications. In this paper, a fuzzy model predictive control (FMPC) approach is introduced to design a control system for a highly nonlinear process. In this approach, a process system is described by a fuzzy convolution model that consists of a number of quasi-linear fuzzy implications (FIs). In controller design, prediction errors and control energy are minimized through a two-layered iterative optimization process. At the lower layer, optimal local control policies are identified to minimize prediction errors in each subsystem. A near optimum is then identified through coordinating the subsystems to reach an overall minimum prediction error at the upper layer. The two-layered computing scheme avoids extensive on-line nonlinear optimization and permits the design of a controller based on linear control theory. The efficacy of the FMPC approach is demonstrated through three examples.},

These layers encode con- straints and complex dependencies between the hidden states that traditional convolutional and fully-connected layers often cannot capture. In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture: we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel optimization, and im- plicit differentiation can be used to exactly differ- entiate through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU- based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which provides backpropaga- tion gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the applica- tion of these approaches in several problems. In one notable example, we show that the method is capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a pri- ori information about the rules of the game; this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard constraints better than other neural architec- tures.},

The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.},

Then, the command shaping is designed to improve the resulting closed-loop dynamics. However, there is an often-overlooked advantage of optimally combining these two control schemes. This study will show that proportional and derivative feedback control can be intelligently used to create a closed- loop system that is particularly advantageous when input shaping is used as a filter outside of the loop.

	Abstract = {To increase wind power integration, it is essential for electric util- ities to accurately predict how much power wind turbines will generate. While purely autoregressive (and nonlinear autoregres- sive) approaches to prediction using historical data perform well for immediate future (10 to 30 minutes ahead) horizons, their accu- racy dramatically deteriorates for farther time horizons. Predicting generation up to 5-6 hours ahead is essential for scheduling multi- tier generation systems that have varying dynamic response. We propose a method that augments autoregressive approaches with exogenous inputs from hyperlocal wind speed forecasts to improve the prediction accuracy and precision beyond 30 min ahead. Our approach reduces the mean absolute error to 2.11%-14.25% for pre- dictions made 10 min to 6 hours ahead. Importantly, it also reduces the uncertainty associated with the predictions by over 15% in comparison with approaches presented in related work.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the quality of the predictions of wind and waves in the Adriatic Sea considering the corresponding analysis and forecast fields of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts up to 72 h. The whole study is based on a 1-year long period 1st Jan--31st Dec 2006 and two hindcast studies of bora events. Global wind fields are used for the analysis. The marine surface wind speeds are corrected for their underestimate with a procedure based on a long term comparison with measured data. The corrected wind fields are then used to run the WAM wave model and to produce the corresponding analysis and forecast wave fields. These are analysed both among themselves and vs buoy data obtained along the Italian coasts. In particular the detailed analysis of a case of bora highlights the sensitivity of the local wind and wave conditions to small changes in the overall meteorological patterns. This strongly suggests that in an enclosed sea the capability of producing successful forecasts beyond a limited time extent is greatly reduced with respect to the oceans.

	Abstract = {Accurate wind speed forecasting is becoming increasingly important to improve and optimize renewable wind power generation. Particularly, reliable short-term wind speed prediction can enable model predic- tive control of wind turbines and real-time optimization of wind farm operation. However, this task remains challenging due to the strong stochastic nature and dynamic uncertainty of wind speed. In this study, unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is integrated with support vector regression (SVR) based state-space model in order to precisely update the short-term estimation of wind speed sequence. In the proposed SVR--UKF approach, support vector regression is first employed to formulate a nonlinear state-space model and then unscented Kalman filter is adopted to perform dynamic state estimation recursively on wind sequence with stochastic uncertainty. The novel SVR--UKF method is compared with artificial neural networks (ANNs), SVR, autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive integrated with Kalman filter (AR-Kalman) approaches for predicting short-term wind speed sequences collected from three sites in Massachusetts, USA. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed method has much better perfor- mance in both one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead wind speed predictions than the other approaches across all the locations.},
	Annote = {Wind speed prediction is split into physical model based approaches and statistical modeling methods
--- Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) techniques (physical) rely on a class of physical models with numerical parameters characterizing local meteorological and geographical properties such as temp, pressure, surface roughness, obstacles, etc.
------ Prediction capability of NWP methods degrades when random uncertainty of weather conditions is strong.
--- Physical usually utilized through integration with statistical modeling methods to combine advantages of both techniques while mitigating restrictions of NWP methods.

Physical models may not capture stochastic nature of wind speed, so statistical models have been developed.
--- Depend on historical data for dynamic predictions without prior knowledge of physical mechanism underlying the wind speed pattern
--- Statistical modeling methods include ANNs, and Time-series models.
--- Time Series models include auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models
------ Several variants now exist, including simplified auto-regressive (AR) and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ARMA/AR with exogenous input (ARMAX/ARX), fractional-ARIMA with differencing parameter being a fractional number.
------ AR, ARMA, and ARIMA require higher model orders to accommodate stochastic variations of wind speed sequence
------ Time-series models are essentially linear; therefore, may not be well-suited for capturing stochastic nature of wind speed uncertain dynamics
--- ANNs map random input vector into output scalar through multi-layer network structure, but does not assume any relationship
------ Use PSO or GA to optimize ANN parameters
------ Not generalizable, so a well-trained ANN can still lead to poor prediction performance

Support Vector Regression (SVR) applied to predict wind speed through nonlinear kernel function based predictive model
---QUESTION: What is a kernel function?
--- Overcomes drawbacks of over-fitting and poor generalization, but does not have strong capacity to handle system uncertainty and stochastic nature of wind speeds.

Wavelet analysis to decompose original time-series of winds peed into different sub-series, then, combined with improved time-series method (ITSM), to forecast the wind speed and power generation

ARIMA applied to build state-space formulation for Kalman filter-based wind speed sequence estimation and update.
--- Kalman filtering relies on basic assumption of Gaussian disturbance, which may not hold for actual wind speed sequence

Markov Chain (MC) is attempted to modify predictions of ANN to avoid overfitting
--- Dividing the wind speed variation into different states for MC is arbitrary and lacks systematic features.

Typically, hybrid model yeidsl more accurate predictions than single kind of method, but proper integration of different types of modeling techniques is non-trivial.


Spatial correlation models provide alternative way for wind speed predictions
--- Use cross-corellation information of wind speed between different geographical locations
--- Wind speed data at neighboring sites used to predict local wind speeds


This paper:
Integration of UKF with support vector regression based nonlinear state-space model framework to enhance capacity of handling stochastic and dynamic uncertainty while minimizing errors of multi-step-ahead wind speed forecasting.
--- SVR to formulate kernel function based nonlinear state-space model structure
--- UKF (over regular KF) is used for recursive state estimation on SVR-based nonlinear state-space model with strong stochastic uncertainty
--- Wind speed sequence is predicted from the UKF-driven SVR model
------ Mitigates prediction errors, accounts for stochastic and dynamic nature of wind speed

Regular AR model can be expressed as:
xk = phi_1*x_km1 + phi_2*x_km2 +{\ldots}+  phi_p*x_kmp + e_k

x_k = measurement at kth sampling instant
phi are regression coefficients are regression coefficients, determined by least squares method, which is based off Yule-Walker equations [38]
p denotes AR model order
e_k = white noise

The motion part and disturbance attenuation part require different placement of tbe actuators to work optimally, which is not possible in traditional designs. Allowing extra actuators in the design makes it possible to overcome this limitation. In this way the controllability of the internal dynamics of the structure can be both maximized for feedback and minimized for feedfonvard. By tuning a static relation between the actuators it is possible to minimize the excitation of resonances in the feedfonvard path. Feedback controller design is based on an existing vibration control strategy, which enables placement of the bandwidth beyond the lowest resonance frequencies. The idea is demonstrated by the example of a levitated beam.},

	Abstract = {Much emphasis has been placed on over-actuated systems for air vehicles. Over-actuating an air vehicle provides a certain amount of redundancy for the flight control system, thus potentially allowing for recovery from off-nominal conditions. Due to this redundancy, control allocation algo- rithms are typically utilized to compute a unique solution to the over-actuated problem. Control allocators compute the commands that are applied to the actuators so that a certain set of forces or moments are generated by the control effectors. Usually, control allocation problems are formulated as optimization problems so that all of the available degrees of freedom can be utilized and, when sufficient control power exists, secondary objectives can be achieved. In this work, a survey of control allocation techniques will be given.},

	Abstract = {Control allocation problems can be formulated as optimization problems, where the objective is typically to minimize the use of control effort (or power) subject to actuator rate and position constraints, and other operational constraints. Here we consider the additional objective of singu- larity avoidance, which is essential to avoid loss of controllability in some applications, leading to a non-convex nonlinear program. We suggest a se- quential quadratic programming approach, solving at each sample a convex quadratic program approximating the nonlinear program. The method is illustrated by simulated maneuvers for a marine vessel equipped with az- imuth thrusters. The example indicates reduced power consumption and increased maneuverability as a consequence of the singularity-avoidance.

	Abstract = {Control allocation deals with the allocation of control among a redundant set of effectors, while taking into account the individual constraints. The use of model predictive control (MPC) for control allocation allows the response times of the actuators to be accounted for, and in particular to take advantage of predictions of the virtual control input as well as differences in dynamic control authority and cost of use among the actuators. The use of online quadratic programming (QP) is essential for implementation of the optimal constrained control allocation strategies. The main contributions of the present paper are the investigation of using the software system CVX- GEN and the MPC-based control allocation method. CVXGEN synthesizes a customized portable and library-free C-source code QP solver for the specific QP problem resulting from the MPC formulation, exploiting structural properties of the QP and optimizing the source code for execution speed. Two case studies, one being a missile auto-pilot, illustrates the benefits of using the MPC formulation, and the efficiency of CVXGEN.},

@article{Johansen:13a,
	Abstract = {The control algorithm hierarchy of motion control for over-actuated mechanical systems with a redundant set of effectors and actuators commonly includes three levels. First, a high-level motion control algorithm commands a vector of virtual control efforts (i.e. forces and moments) in order to meet the overall motion control objectives. Second, a control allocation algorithm coordinates the different effectors such that they together produce the desired virtual control efforts, if possible. Third, low-level control algorithms may be used to control each individual effector via its actuators. Control allocation offers the advantage of a modular design where the high-level motion control algorithm can be designed without detailed knowledge about the effectors and actuators. Important issues such as input saturation and rate constraints, actuator and effector fault tolerance, and meeting secondary objectives such as power efficiency and tear-and-wear minimization are handled within the control allocation algorithm. The objective of the present paper is to survey control allocation algorithms, motivated by the rapidly growing range of applications that have expanded from the aerospace and maritime industries, where control allocation has its roots, to automotive, mechatronics, and other industries. The survey classifies the different algorithms according to two main classes based on the use of linear or nonlinear models, respectively. The presence of physical constraints (e.g input saturation and rate constraints), operational constraints and secondary objectives makes optimization-based design a powerful approach. The simplest formulations allow explicit solutions to be computed using numerical linear algebra in combination with some logic and engineering solutions, while the more challenging formulations with nonlinear models or complex constraints and objectives call for iterative numerical optimization procedures. Experiences using the different methods in aerospace, maritime, automotive and other application areas are discussed. The paper ends with some perspectives on new applications and theoretical challenges.},

	Abstract = {In this paper an energy optimal control strategy for a highly maneuverable Robotic Electric Vehicle (ROboMObil) is presented. The ROMO is a development of the Robotics and Mechatronics Center (which is part of the German Aerospace Center) to cope with several research topics, like energy efficient, autonomous or remote controlled driving for future (electro-) mobility applications. Since saving electric energy is a primal goal when operating a battery electric vehicle (like the ROMO), we have developed a new approach for energy optimal control of an over-actuated electric car. The focus of the control strategy lies in the model based minimization of the actuator losses and power consumption for driving along a precalculated trajectory to optimize the overall efficiency. The approach is based on a real-time capable nonlinear control allocation (CA) algorithm, using quadratic programming, implemented in the object oriented modeling language Modelica. Two optimization objectives are analyzed and the performance is presented by simulation results. Finally an CA extension to nonlinear dynamic inversion is discussed, which is able to compensate the different time constants of the actuators.},

	Abstract = {This paper adresses the problem of nonlinear control allocation applied to marine vessels. An energy optimal solution combining a static and a dynamic non-recursive algorithm is proposed. Ships equipped with azimuth (rotatable) and tunnel (fixed) thrusters are considered. The static-solution gives the optimal orientation of the thrust forces corresponding to minimum use of power, whereas the dynamic solution provides dynamic capabilities. The dynamic-solution uses the Damped Least-Squares pseudo inverse of the Jacobian matrix about the static-solution. This guarantees singularity robustness, i.e. bounded solutions in all singular points. The combined solution (static and dynamic allocation) gives a 37% reduction in thrust compared to the pure static solution when simulated on a supply vessel. Experiments with a model ship are also reported.},

	Abstract = {This thesis explored the path following applications of autonomous driving, where the purpose is to sense the environment and navigate to a goal without human intervention. Autonomous driving enables safer journeys by removing human error in driving, as well as reducing fuel consumption and driving time by optimizing the engine and brake actuation. In 2017 it is a well researched topic in the academic and industrial world.
The scope of this work was to create a reliable and efficient path following solution which enabled a robot car to accurately traverse along any given path. The objective was therefore to minimize path error with the additional objective to minimize the traversal time.
The method used to realize the objective statement was Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC). MPCC uses optimization based prediction to smoothly control the car along a reference path, where actuator constraints and the objective are both handled in the optimization problem. The refer- ence was also defined as a geometric function instead of a specified trajec- tory of coordinates. With the addition of objective weights it was possible to choose the relative importance of the two objectives, path accuracy and minimizing time. The resulting problem formulation, which was heavily non- linear, was linearized to reduce computation time and solved using FORCES Pro. Simulations where made in Simulink, while real-time execution of the MPCC were achieved with a robot prototype, Robotics Operating System (ROS) and Matlab.
The result suggested that MPCC was able to operate efficiently in a real time environment. Manipulating the objective weights resulted in predictable operation, which makes it possible for a user to control whether faster traver- sal or tracking performance is desired. It can be concluded that MPCC is a viable control method for autonomous driving, in particular for autonomous racing purposes. Additionally, the simulation results regarding the non-linear MPCC showed a surprisingly fast solve time, which suggest that it would be feasible for on-line driving using the solver FORCES Pro.},

	Abstract = {
Driving requires reacting to a wide variety of complex environment conditions and agent behaviors. Explicitly modeling each possible scenario is unrealistic. In contrast, imitation learning can, in theory, leverage data from large fleets of human-driven cars. Behavior cloning in particular has been successfully used to learn simple visuomotor poli- cies end-to-end, but scaling to the full spectrum of driving behaviors remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark to experimentally investigate the scalability and limitations of behavior cloning. We show that behavior cloning leads to state-of-the-art results, in- cluding in unseen environments, executing complex lateral and longitudinal maneuvers without these reactions being explicitly programmed. However, we confirm well-known limitations (due to dataset bias and overfitting), new gener- alization issues (due to dynamic objects and the lack of a causal model), and training instability requiring further re- search before behavior cloning can graduate to real-world driving. We will release our benchmark and code.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of a non- linear model predictive tracking control (NMPTC) for autonomous helicopters. We formulate a NMPTC algorithm for planning paths under input and state constraints and tracking the generated position and heading trajectories, and implement an on-line op- timization controller using gradient-descent method. The proposed NMPTC algorithm demonstrates supe- rior tracking performance over conventional multi-loop proportional-derivative (MLPD) controllers especially when nonlinearity and coupling dominate the vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, NMPTC shows outstanding robustness to parameter uncertainty, and input sat- uration and state constraints are easily incorporated. When the cost includes an potential function with a possibly moving obstacle or other agents' state infor- mation, the NMPTC can solve the trajectory planning and control problem in a single step. This constitutes a promising one-step solution for trajectory generation and regulation for RUAVs, which operate under vari- ous uncertainties and constraints arising from the ve- hicle dynamics and environmental contingencies. The computation load of this approach is significantly less than many existing model predictive algorithms, thus enabling real-time applications for autonomous heli- copters.},

We address two major aspects of exploration- map building and obstacle avoidance- by combining model predictive control (MPC) with a local obstacle map builder. An onboard laser scanner is used to build the online map of obstacles around the vehicle during the flight. A real-time MPC algorithm with a cost function that penalizes the distance to the nearest obstacle replans the path. The adjusted trajectory is sent to the position tracking layer in the Berkeley UAV avionics. The proposed approach is implemented on Berkeley rotorcraft UAVs and successfully tested in urban flight experiment setup.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is used to design a high-level controller for a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Given the kinematic model of the UAV dynamics, which is used as a model of the UAV with low-level autopilot avionics, the control objective of the NMPC is determined to track a desired line. After the error dynamics are derived, the problem of tracking a desired line is transformed into a problem of regulating the error from the desired line. A stability analysis follows to provide the conditions that can assure the closed-loop stability of the designed high-level NMPC. Furthermore, the con- trol objective is extended to track adjoined multiple line segments. The simulation results demonstrate that the UAV controlled by the NMPC converged rapidly with a small overshoot. The performance of the NMPC was also verified through realistic ``hardware in the loop simulation.''},

For 2D positioning the principle of optical flow is used. Together with the output of height estimation, fusing ultrasonic, infrared and inertial and pressure sensor data, the 3D position of the UAV can be computed, controlled and steered. All data processing is done on the UAV. An external computer with a pathway planning interface is for commanding purposes only. The presented system is part of the AQopterI8 project, which aims to develop an autonomous flying quadrocopter for indoor application. The focus of this paper is 2D positioning using an optical flow sensor. As a result of the performed evaluation, it can be concluded that for position hold, the standard deviation of the position error is 10cm and after landing the position error is about 30cm.},

A linear model predictive controller is used to take advantage of the fast algorithms available to solve convex optimization problems.

Obtained simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MPCTT approach, generating a substantially less control effort in order to track waypoint trajectories. The unmanned helicopter used for the proposed MPCTT system is considered as a (linearized) linear state- space model obtained for hovering and slow motion; however, as shown, the MPCTT is robust enough to perform trajectory tracking under a cruise flight mode, too.},

Various results pertaining to move blocking are derived, following which, a generalised blocked VH-MPC controller is formulated for linear discrete-time systems. Robustness to bounded disturbances is ensured through the use of tightened constraints. The resulting time-varying control scheme is shown to guarantee robust recursive feasibility and finite-time completion. An example is then presented for a particular choice of blocking regime, as would be applicable to vehicle man{\oe}uvring problems. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the formulation.},

	Abstract = {Overactuated systems often arise in automotive, aerospace, and robotics applications, where for reasons of redundancy or performance constraints, it is beneficial to equip a system with more control inputs than outputs. This necessitates control allocation methods that distribute control effort amongst many actuators to achieve a desired effect. Until recently, most methods have treated the control allocation as static in the sense that different dynamic authorities of the actuators were not taken into account. Recent advances have used model predictive control allocation (MPCA) to consider the dynamic authorities of the actuators over a receding horizon. In this paper, we consider the dynamic control allocation problem for overactuated systems where each actuator has different dynamic control authority and hard saturation limits. A modular control design approach is proposed, where the controller consists of an outer loop controller that synthesizes a desired virtual control input signal and an inner loop controller that uses MPCA to achieve the desired virtual control signal. We derive sufficient stability conditions for the composite feedback system and show how these conditions may be realized by imposing an additional constraint on the MPCA design. An automotive example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Determination of ship maneuvering models is a tough task of ship maneuverability prediction. Among several prime approaches of estimating ship maneuvering models, system identification combined with the full‐scale or free‐ running model test is preferred. In this contribution, real‐time system identification programs using recursive identification method, such as the recursive least square method (RLS), are exerted for on‐line identification of ship maneuvering models. However, this method seriously depends on the objects of study and initial values of identified parameters. To overcome this, an intelligent technology, i.e., support vector machines (SVM), is firstly used to estimate initial values of the identified parameters with finite samples. As real measured motion data of the Mariner class ship always involve noise from sensors and external disturbances, the zigzag simulation test data include a substantial quantity of Gaussian white noise. Wavelet method and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are used to filter the data corrupted by noise, respectively. The choice of the sample number for SVM to decide initial values of identified parameters is extensively discussed and analyzed. With de‐noised motion data as input‐output training samples, parameters of ship maneuvering models are estimated using RLS and SVM‐RLS, respectively. The comparison between identification results and true values of parameters demonstrates that both the identified ship maneuvering models from RLS and SVM‐RLS have reasonable agreements with simulated motions of the ship, and the increment of the sample for SVM positively affects the identification results. Furthermore, SVM‐RLS using data de‐noised by EMD shows the highest accuracy and best convergence.},

	Abstract = {Trajectory optimizers are a powerful class of methods for generating goal-directed robot motion. Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an indirect method which optimizes only over the unconstrained control-space and is therefore fast enough to allow real-time control of a full hu- manoid robot on modern computers. Although indirect methods automatically take into account state constraints, control limits pose a difficulty. This is particularly problematic when an expensive robot is strong enough to break itself.
In this paper, we demonstrate that simple heuristics used to enforce limits (clamping and penalizing) are not efficient in general. We then propose a generalization of DDP which ac- commodates box inequality constraints on the controls, without significantly sacrificing convergence quality or computational effort. We apply our algorithm to three simulated problems, including the 36-DoF HRP-2 robot. A movie of our results can be found here goo.gl/eeiMnn},

	Abstract = {More than 15 years after model predictive control (MPC) appeared in industry as an effective means to deal with multivariable constrained control problems, a theoretical basis for this technique has started to emerge. The issues of feasibility of the on-line optimization, stability and performance are largely understood for systems described by linear models. Much progress has been made on these issues for non-linear systems but for practical applications many questions remain, including the reliability and efficiency of the on-line computation scheme. To deal with model uncertainty `rigorously' an involved dynamic programming problem must be solved. The approximation techniques proposed for this purpose are largely at a conceptual stage. Among the broader research needs the following areas are identified: multivariable system identification, performance monitoring and diagnostics, non-linear state estimation, and batch system control. Many practical problems like control objective prioritization and symptom-aided diagnosis can be integrated systematically and effectively into the MPC framework by expanding the problem formulation to include integer variables yielding a mixed-integer quadratic or linear program. Efficient techniques for solving these problems are becoming available.},

	Abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be used to control a system of energy producers and consumers in a Smart Grid. In this paper, we use heat pumps for heating residential buildings with a floor heating system. We use the thermal capacity of the building to shift the energy consumption to periods with low electricity prices. In this way the heating system of the house becomes a flexible power consumer in the Smart Grid. This scenario is relevant for systems with a significant share of stochastic energy producers, e.g. wind turbines, where the ability to shift power consumption according to production is crucial. We present a model for a house with a ground source based heat pump used for supplying thermal energy to a water based floor heating system. The model is a linear state space model and the resulting controller is an Economic MPC formulated as a linear program. The model includes forecasts of both weather and electricity price. Simulation studies demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model and algorithm. Compared to traditional operation of heat pumps with constant electricity prices, the optimized operating strategy saves 25-35% of the electricity cost.},

@conference{Falanga:18a,
	Abstract = {We present the first perception-aware model pre- dictive control framework for quadrotors that unifies control and planning with respect to action and perception objectives. Our framework leverages numerical optimization to compute trajectories that satisfy the system dynamics and require control inputs within the limits of the platform. Simultaneously, it optimizes perception objectives for robust and reliable sens- ing by maximizing the visibility of a point of interest and minimizing its velocity in the image plane. Considering both perception and action objectives for motion planning and control is challenging due to the possible conflicts arising from their respective requirements. For example, for a quadrotor to track a reference trajectory, it needs to rotate to align its thrust with the direction of the desired acceleration. However, the perception objective might require to minimize such rotation to maximize the visibility of a point of interest. A model-based optimization framework, able to consider both perception and action objectives and couple them through the system dynamics, is therefore necessary. Our perception-aware model predictive control framework works in a receding-horizon fashion by iteratively solving a non-linear optimization problem. It is capable of running in real-time, fully onboard our lightweight, small-scale quadrotor using a low-power ARM computer, to- gether with a visual-inertial odometry pipeline. We validate our approach in experiments demonstrating (I) the conflict between perception and action objectives, and (II) improved behavior in extremely challenging lighting conditions.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for modeling and controlling systems described by interdependent physical laws, logic rules, and operating constraints, denoted as mixed logical dynamical (MLD) systems. These are described by linear dynamic equations subject to linear inequalities involving real and integer variables. MLD systems include linear hybrid systems, finite state machines, some classes of discrete event systems, constrained linear systems, and nonlinear systems which can be approximated by piecewise linear functions. A predictive control scheme is proposed which is able to stabilize MLD systems on desired reference trajectories while fulfilling operating constraints, and possibly take into account previous qualitative knowledge in the form of heuristic rules. Due to the presence of integer variables, the resulting on-line optimization procedures are solved through mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP), for which efficient solvers have been recently developed. Some examples and a simulation case study on a complex gas supply system are reported.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to trajectory op- timization for autonomous fixed-wing aerial vehicles performing large-scale maneuvers. T h e main result is a planner which designs nearly minimum time planar trajectories to a goal, constrained by no-fly zones and the vehicle's maximum speed and turning rate. Mixed- Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is used for the op- timization, and is well suited to trajectory optimization because it can incorporate logical constraints, such as no-fly zone avoidance, and continuous constraints, such as aircraft dynamics. MILP is applied over a receding planning horizon to reduce the computational effort of the planner and to incorporate feedback. In this ap- proach, MILP is used to plan short trajectories that extend towards the goal, but do not necessarily reach it. The cost function accounts for decisions beyond the planning horizon by estimating the time to reach the goal from the plan's end point. This time is estimated by searching a graph representation of the environment. This approach is shown t o avoid entrapment behind ob- stacles, to yield near-optimal performance when com- parison with the minimum arrival time found using a fixed horizon controller is possible, and to work consis- tently on large trajectory optimization problems that
are intractable for the fixed horizon controller.},

	Abstract = {The use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in Building Management Systems (BMS) has proven to out- perform the traditional Rule-Based Controllers (RBC). These optimal controllers are able to minimize the energy use within building, by taking into account the weather forecast and occupancy profiles, while guar- anteeing thermal comfort in the building. To this end, they anticipate the dynamic behaviour based on a mathematical model of the system. However, these MPC strategies are still not widely used in practice because a substantial engineering effort is needed to identify a tailored model for each building and Heat Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system.

Different procedures already exist to obtain these controller models: white-, grey-, and black-box modelling methods are used for this end. It is hard to determine which approach is the best to be used based on the literature, and the best choice may even depend on the particular case considered (availability of building plans, Building Information Models (BIM), HVAC technical sheets, measurement data). Nevertheless, the vast majority of researchers prefer the grey-box option.

In this paper a Python-based toolbox, named Fast Simulations (FastSim), that automates the process of setting up and assessing MPC algorithms for their application in buildings, is presented. It provides a modular, extensible and scalable framework thanks to its block-based architecture. In this layout, each of the blocks represents a feature of the controller, such as state-estimation, weather forecast or optimization. Moreover, the interactions between blocks occur through standardized signals facilitating the inclusion of new add-ons to the framework.

The approach is tested and verified by simulations using a grey-box model as the controller model and a detailed Modelica model as the emulator. A time-varying Kalman filter is applied to estimate the unmeasured states of the controller model.
FastSim is developed and used in a research environment, however this automated process will also facilitate the implementation of MPC for different building systems, both in virtual and real life.},

	Abstract = {We present foundations for using Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a differen- tiable policy class for reinforcement learning in continuous state and action spaces. This provides one way of leveraging and combining the advantages of model-free and model-based approaches. Specifically, we differentiate through MPC by using the KKT conditions of the convex approximation at a fixed point of the controller. Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class. We show that our MPC policies are significantly more data-efficient than a generic neural network and that our method is superior to traditional system identification in a setting where the expert is unrealizable.},
	Annote = {Section 3: Differentiable LQR
Discrete LQR optimizes a convex quadratic objective function w.r.t. affine state-transition dynamics.

Interpreting LQR from optimization perspective (Boyd, 2008), we associate dual variables with state constraints. Lambda0 is associated with x1 = xinit and Lambda1:T-1 is with the remaining ones, therefore, optimization Lagrangian takes the form of (4)

Differentiating (4) ---> Gradient of Lagrangian ---> (5)
* Solving LQR problems with dynamic Riccati recursion is efficient way of solving the KKT conditions (6)

Given optimal nominal trajectory (goal states), (5) shows how to compute the optimal dual variables Lambda with backwards recursion (7)
*Ctx, ctx, and Ftx are first block-rows of Ct, ct, and Ft
* With optimal trajectory and dual variables, we can compute gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters
** Since LQR is a constrained convex quadratic minimization program, the derivatives of the loss w.r.t. the LQR parameters can be obtained implicitly by differentiation through the KKT conditions.

Section 4: Differentiable MPC
LQR does not cover realistic control problems with nonlinear dynamics and cost functions. Further, more problems have natural bounds on control space, which can be expressed as a box constraint
* Highly non-convex problems like these are well-studied in general form, and can be expressed in general form as (10)
* Standard way of iteratively forming and optimizing the convex approximation (11)

Second-order Taylor Series approximation of cost around current states, Tau_i: (12)
First-order dynamics around Tau_i: (13)

 Fixed point of (11) is often reached, especially with smooth dynamics.
* Differentiation of non-convex problem (10) can be done using the final convex approximation.
* Without the box constraints, the fixed point in (11) could be differentiated with LQR.

Generic box-constrained convex QPs of form (14)
With active inequality constraings of form Gx = h, the problem becomes an equality constrained problem with the solution given by the linear system (15)

Need a loss function that depends on the optimal states, x*, and can obtain derivatives w.r.t. Q, p, A, and b as in (16)
* dx* and dlambda* are obtained by solving (17)

Therefore, solving (17) is equivalent to solving the optimization problem (18)

At a fixed point, can use (16) to compute the derivatives of the MPC problem, where dtau* and dlambda* are found by solving (9) with an additional constraint, duti = 0 if uti* is in the set of {uti_min, uti_max}.
* This can be equivalently written as a zero-constrained LQR problem of the form (19)
** n is iteration that (11) reaches a fixed point, H^n and F^n are the corresponding approximations to objective and dynamics.

Drawbacks of the approach:
Sometimes the controller does not run long enough to reach the fixed point of (11), or a fixed point doesnt exist
* This often happens when using NNs to approximate the dynamics (backprop=false)
* As a result, (19) cannot be used to differentiate through the controller because it assumes a fixed point.
Differentiation through the final iLQR iterate that is not a fixed point will usually give incorrect gradients
* Possible solution is treating the iLQR procedure as a compute graph and differentiation through unrolled operations
**  Backwards pass of this method scales linearly with number of iLQR iterations used in the forward pass.

Fixed-point differentiation is constant time and only requires a single LQR solve.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is presented for tracking of underactuated vessels with only two available controls: namely, surge force and yaw moment. When no external disturbance is explicitly considered, the pro- posed MPC approach iteratively solves a formulated quadratic programming (QP) problem using a single-layer recurrent neural network called the general projection network over a finite receding horizon. When additive disturbances are taken into ac- count, a reformulated minimax optimization problem is iteratively solved by using a two-layer recurrent neural network. The applied neural networks are both stable in the sense of Lyapunov and globally convergent to the exact optimal solutions of reformulated convex programming problems. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed neurodynamics-based MPC approaches to vessel tracking control.},

	Abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tech- nique for solving dynamic control tasks. In this paper, we show that there exists a close connection between MPC and online learning, an abstract theoretical framework for analyzing online decision making in the optimization literature. This new perspec- tive provides a foundation for leveraging powerful online learning algorithms to design MPC algorithms. Specifically, we propose a new algorithm based on dynamic mirror descent (DMD), an on- line learning algorithm that is designed for non-stationary setups. Our algorithm, Dynamic Mirror Descent Model Predictive Con- trol (DMD-MPC), represents a general family of MPC algorithms that includes many existing techniques as special instances. DMD- MPC also provides a fresh perspective on previous heuristics used in MPC and suggests a principled way to design new MPC algorithms. In the experimental section of this paper, we demonstrate the flexibility of DMD-MPC, presenting a set of new MPC algorithms on a simple simulated cartpole and a simulated and real-world aggressive driving task.

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient neural network (NN) approach to tracking control of an autonomous sur- face vehicle (ASV) with completely unknown vehicle dynamics and subject to significant uncertainties. The proposed NN has a single-layer structure by utilising the vehicle regressor dynamics that expresses the highly nonlinear dynamics in terms of the known and unknown dynamic parameters. The learning algorithm of the NN is simple yet computationally efficient. It is derived from Lyapunov stability analysis, which guarantees that all the error signals in the control system are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). The proposed NN approach can force the ASV to track the desired trajectory with good control perfor- mance through the on-line learning of the NN without any off-line learning procedures. In addition, the proposed controller is capable of compensating bounded unknown disturbances. The effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated by simulation and comparison studies.},

	Abstract = {This work presents an explicit-implicit procedure that combines an offline trained neural network with an online primal active set solver to compute a model predictive control (MPC) law with guarantees on recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The neural network improves the suboptimality of the controller performance and accelerates online inference speed for large systems, while the primal active set method provides corrective steps to ensure feasibility and stability. We highlight the connections between MPC and neural networks and introduce a primal-dual loss function to train a neural network to initialize the online controller. We then demonstrate online computation of the primal feasibility and suboptimality criteria to provide the desired guarantees. Next, we use these neural network and criteria measures to accelerate an online primal active set method through warm starts and early termination. Finally, we present a data set generation algorithm that is critical for successfully applying our approach to high dimensional systems. The primary motivation is developing an algorithm that scales to systems that are challenging for current approaches, involving state and input dimensions as well as planning horizons in the order of tens to hundreds.},

By integrating ``GPS''modules and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) into the robot,we demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking of the robotic boatalong preplanned paths in both a swimming pool and a naturalriver.  Furthermore,  the  code  generation  strategy  employed  inour  paper  yields  a  two  order  of  magnitude  improvement  inthe  run  time  of  the  NMPC  algorithm  compared  to  similarsystems.

To realize track-keeping control on rivers the representation of a desired track by splines is introduced, suitable to describe the curved course on a waterway.

Second, nonlinear model predictive control is realized to guide a ship along the desired track. This special application of model predictive control is explained in more detail. Problems and advantages of the control methods are outlined. Both control methods have been implemented in an integrated navigation system for inland navigation, and have been tested by computer simulations and experiments on inland vessels.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) approach for controlling an active front steering system in an autonomous vehicle is presented. At each time step, a trajectory is assumed to be known over a finite horizon, and an MPC controller computes the front steering angle in order to follow the trajectory on slippery roads at the highest possible entry speed. We present two approaches with different computational complexities. In the first approach, we formulate the MPC problem by using a nonlinear vehicle model. The second approach is based on suc- cessive online linearization of the vehicle model. Discussions on computational complexity and performance of the two schemes are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC formulation is demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests up to 21 m/s on icy roads.},

	Abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC)-based path following schemes for autonomous cars represent a novel and highly debated control approach. Their high online computational load poses a challenge for practical real-time application in vehicle systems with fast dynamics. This paper proposes an implementation scheme for an MPC path following controller that considers the feasible road region and vehicle shape. Moreover, the model mismatch induced by varying road conditions and small-angle assumptions is considered in the form of a measurable disturbance. To solve the optimization problem for the proposed MPC path following controller, a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is adopted. To verify the computational performance of the proposed implementation scheme, an experimental platform was developed that consists of the Hongqi autonomous car HQ430, various sensors, and systems for communication and data processing. The experi- mental results indicate that the proposed DE-based implementation strategy for the MPC path following controller achieves good computational performance and satisfactory control performance for path following in autonomous cars.},

Predictive control techniques are a very important area of active research
* Reference trajectory is known beforehand
* Most predictive controllers use a linear model of mobile-robot kinematics to predict on

[4] --- Nonlinear predictive controller scheme for path-tracking problem is proposed. Multi-layer NN is employed to model the nonlinear kinematic behavior of a mobile robot. Optimum solution of control vector is solved by optimization of a cost function



This paper uses a differentially driven mobile robot. MPC control law is based on linearized error dynamics model obtained around the reference trajectory
* Analytically derived control law, and is, therefore, computationally effective and used in fast real-time implementations.

MPC control obtained is compared to well-known time-varying state-tracking control law, as seen in [5, 20, 12].

Design of the state-tracking control law in discrete time is given.

Uses a 33 ms sampling time on the high-level planning controller

Maximum allowable acceleration is determined experimentally so the robot never slips

Trajectory tracking controlllers of linear time-varying systems are obtained from approximate linearization around the trajectory.
* Linarization is shown to be controllable as long as the trajectory does not come to a stop, which implies that the system can be asymptotically stabilized by smooth linear or nonlinear feedback [20, 21, 11, 3].

Derives the controllability matrix of the system, and shows that it is full rank if either of the tangential/angular velocity are non-zero.

Derives the error dynamics in discrete time using the A and B matrices and control input, the error in the predictions, the predicted control vector, and the reference error-tracking trajectory.

(21) is the cost function following the form that was derived
(22) is the resulting control vector
(25) is the feedback control law
* Kmpc dot(e(k)) is Rank (m x n)
* Kmpc is the gain matrix

Controller gains are determined by comparing the actual and desired characteristic polynomial equations, which takes the form of (28)

Are these controller gains the diagonal of Kmpc? Or are they the weights on the states, Q? Or are those two things identical?

	Abstract = {Mobile robots tracking a reference trajectory are constrained by the motion limits of their actuators, which impose the requirement for high autonomy driving capabilities in robots. This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) scheme incorporating neural-dynamic optimization to achieve trajectory tracking of nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs). By using the derived tracking-error kinematics of nonholonomic robots, the proposed MPC approach is iteratively transformed as a con- strained quadratic programming (QP) problem, and then a primal--dual neural network is used to solve this QP problem over a finite receding horizon. The applied neural-dynamic opti- mization can make the cost function of MPC converge to the exact optimal values of the formulated constrained QP. Compared with the existing fast MPC, which requires repeatedly calculat- ing the Hessian matrix of the Langragian and then solves a quadratic program. The computation complexity reaches O(n3), while the proposed neural-dynamic optimization contains O(n2) operations. Finally, extensive experiments are provided to illus- trate that the MPC scheme has an effective performance on a real mobile robot system.},

	Abstract = {Small-scale helicopters are very attractive for a wide range of civilian and military applications due to their unique features. However, the autonomous flight for small helicopters is quite challenging because they are naturally unstable, have strong nonlinearities and couplings, and are very susceptible to wind and small structural variations.
A nonlinear optimal control scheme is proposed to address these issues. It consists of a nonlinear model predictive controller (MPC) and a nonlinear disturbance observer. First, an analytical solution of the MPC is developed based on the nominal model under the assumption that all disturbances are measurable. Then, a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to estimate the influence of the external force/torque introduced by wind turbulences, unmodelled dynamics and variations of the helicopter dynamics. The global asymptotic stability of the composite controller has been established through stability analysis. Flight tests including hovering under wind gust and performing very challenging pirouette have been carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control scheme.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method for adaptively updating nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) horizon lengths online via nonlinear programming (NLP) sensitivity calculations. This approach depends on approximation of the infinite horizon problem via selection of terminal conditions, and therefore calculation of non-conservative terminal conditions is key. For this, we also present a new method for calculating terminal regions and costs based on the quasi-infinite horizon framework that extends to large-scale nonlinear systems. This is accomplished via bounds found through simulations under lin- ear quadratic regulator (LQR) control. We show that the resulting controller is Input-to-State practically Stable (ISpS) with a stability constant that depends on the level of nonlinearity in the terminal region. Finally, we demonstrate this approach on a quad-tank system and a large-scale distillation application. Simulation results reveal that the proposed approach is able to achieve significant reduction in average computation time without much loss in the performance with reference to fixed horizon NMPC.},
	Annote = {[14, 28, 25, 27]  note that exact solution of the nonlinear programming problem is not necessary, but terminal conditions are important for ensuring NMPC stability

[1] utilizes a quasi-infinite horizon approach in which the terminal cost is based on controller for linearized system, and terminal region represents a region of attraction for the linear controller applied to the nonlinear system

This paper proposes bounding the higher order nonilnear effects of the system via simulations under LQR control
--- Leads to method of calculating terminal cost to approximate the infinite horizon problem
--- Key for stability considerations later

Desirable to have a method for updating horizon lengths online

[22, 23] provide insight into traditonal variable horizon MPC, where it's treated as decision variable in the optimization problem
--- In nonlinear case, this leads to solving Mixed Integer NL Program online, which is impractical to solve online, currently.

AH-NMPC, where prediction horizon is updated online via some rule.
--- I have my rule, but how can I justify it?

This paper proposes to choose horizon length in real time based on the current state
--- Terminal conditions serve to approximate the infinite horizon problem, regardless of how horizon changes from time step to time step

This paper also proposes to use sensitivity updates from sIOPT in order to choose a sufficient horizon length in real time.

This paper combined technologies of quasi-infinite horizon NMPC and adaptive horizon NMPC to provide a flexible NMPC formulation that retains stability properties with an adaptive horizon length.

This paper chooses horizon size based on the sensitivity calculations and uses a safety factor and an upper limit on horizon size, N_max, that guarantees feasibility. N_s, the safety factor chosen horizon, serves as minimum horizon length.
--- Mine is different because I'm choosing based on the system states, and seeing if I can get a performance increase versus trying to find a feasible solution. Is this a correct interpretation?

Uses one dynamic optimization problem and one sensitivity calculation at each iteration for online implementation

The control system intelligently controls the vehicle to go from origin to destination avoiding the obstacles in its path. Depending on the anticipated danger of the obstacle, the vehicle chooses an angle of divergence which avoids the obstacles and keeps the speed of the vehicle. The proposed control system of the vehicle has two main controllers. The first one is speed controller and the second one is nozzle controller.

	Abstract = { The literature on thrust allocation algorithms that is currently available usually focuses on solving only a few of the many facets of the thrust allocation problem at a time. This paper presents a unified thrust allocation algorithm that solves most of the challenges that are faced by the practitioners in one algorithm. This includes controlling thrusters that can change the direction of the generated thrust slowly and/or reverse the direction of the generated thrust, minimizing the power consumption and wear-and-tear in the thrusters, and handling thruster saturations. When rotable thrusters are present, a functionality to avoid driving the thruster system into singular configurations should normally be included. This functionality requires significant numerical calculations for each iteration of the thrust allocation algorithm. In the presented work those calculations were written in explicit form using a symbolic processor, translated to ANSI C and compiled. This technique was demonstrated to provide acceptable real-time performance.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a modified fast marching (FM) path planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The modified FM algorithm generates a two-layered synthetic vector field to represent a dynamic environment. The synthetic vector field integrates the obstacle information and the environment information, where current and wind velocities vary in both magnitude and direction. The path planning algorithm then employs the anisotropic FM method to calculate a safe trajectory to avoid obstacles and to minimise any negative effects of the environment. The algorithm has been tested in the environment with simulated current. The resulting trajectory shows that the two-layered FM algorithm is able to deal with environmental influence satisfactory.},

	Abstract = {A new method combining trajectory planning, tracking and coordinated control for unmanned surface vessels is presented based on nonlinear sliding mode control. A limiting factor of sliding mode tracking control is that it can only guarantee position tracking as long as the vessel initial conditions are on the desired trajectory. In this work, a transitional trajectory between the vessel initial condition and the desired trajectory path is implemented using a set of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in terms of the position state feedbacks such that the ODE solution converges to the desired trajectory path. An additional advantage of this approach is that when the ODE represents a limit cycle, it can be used for coordinating multiple vessel trajectories without any possibility of collision. Several simulations are presented where the vessel successfully reaches and follows a desired trajectory starting from a variety of initial starting conditions.},

	Abstract = {Efficient path planning is a critical issue for the navigation of modern unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) characterized by a complex operating environment having dynamic obstacles with a spatially variable ocean current. The current work explores an A* approach with an USV enclosed by a circular boundary as a safety distance constraint on generation of optimal waypoints to resolve the problem of motion planning for an USV moving in a maritime environment. Unlike existing work on USV navigation using graph based methods, this study extends the implementation of the proposed A* approach in an environment cluttered with static and moving obstacles and different current intensities. The study also examines the effect of headwind and tailwind currents moving in clockwise and anti clockwise direction respectively of different intensities on optimal waypoints in a partially dynamic environment. The performance of the proposed approach is verified in si- mulations for different environmental conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is measured using two parameters, namely, path length and computational time as considered in other research works. The results show that the proposed approach is effective for global path planning of USVs.},

A trajectory tracking controller designed originally for robotic systems is applied for underactuated surface ships. Such a model is represented by numerical methods and, from this approach, the control actions for an optimal operation of the system are obtained. Its main advantage is that the condition for the tracking error tends to zero, and the calculation of control actions are obtained solving a system of linear equations. The proofs of convergence to zero of the tracking error are presented here and complete the previous work of the authors. Simulation results show the good performance of the proposed control system.},

	Abstract = {Field trials of a 4 m long, 180 kg, unmanned surface vehicle (USV) have been conducted to evaluate the performance of station-keeping heading and position controllers in an outdoor marine environment disturbed by wind and current. The USV has a twin hull configuration and a custom-designed propulsion system, which consists of two azimuthing thrusters, one for each hull. Nonlinear proportional derivative, backstepping and sliding mode feedback controllers were tested in winds of about 4--5 knots, with and without wind feedforward control. The controllers were tested when the longitudinal axis of the USV was aligned with the mean wind direction and when the longitudinal axis was perpendicular to the mean wind direction. It was found that the sliding mode controller performed best overall and that the addition of wind feedforward control did not significantly improve its effectiveness. However, wind feedforward control did substantially improve the performance of the proportional derivative and backstepping controllers when the mean wind direction was perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the USV. An analysis of the length scales present in the power spectrum of the turbulent speed fluctuations in the wind suggests that a single anemometer is sufficient to characterize the speed and direction of the wind acting on the USV.},

	Abstract = {The ability of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to maintain a fixed orientation and position for an extended period of time is essential for a variety of applications such as acoustic and optical localization and automated launch and recovery of other systems. The need for station-keeping capabilities on USVs requires collaboration between the controller and the propulsion system, both designed to allow the vehicle to perform this challenging maneuver. Small external perturbations, such as wind, waves and current, can have tremendous effects on low weight USVs. These can negatively affect the USV ability to hold its state, resulting in large errors or oscillations. A robust controller capable to account for unmodeled dynamics, which lead to significant deviations between simulated and experimental results, is therefore essential. After an appropriate propulsion system had been designed and installed on a USV, several station- keeping controllers were implemented and tested. Experimental testing of these controllers in environments of uncertain wind, current and wave disturbances show that the vehicle is best controlled by a nonlinear, backstepping, Multi-Input Multi- output (MIMO) PD controller. A Lagrangian multiplier method was used for control allocation. It is shown that a USV equipped with azimuthing electric propellers is capable to reach and maintain a specific configuration of heading and position for a period of ten or more minutes.},

Time-invariant dis- continuous feedback control laws are then con- structed to asymptotically stabilize the system to the desired configuration with exponential convergence rates.

	Abstract = {There have been much technological advances and research in Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) as a support and delivery platform for Autonomous/Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (AUV/UUV) or Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). Advantages include extending underwater search and survey operations time and reach, improving underwater positioning and mission awareness, in addition to minimizing the costs and risks associated with similar manned vessel operations. The objective of this paper is to present the design and development a high-level fuzzy logic guidance controller for a WAM-V 14 unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in order to autonomously launch and recover a REMUS 100 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The approach to meeting this objective is to develop ability for the USV to intercept and rendezvous with an AUV that is in transit in order to maximize the probability of a final mobile docking maneuver. Specifically, a fuzzy logic Rendezvous-Docking controller has been developed that generates Waypoint- Heading goals for the USV to minimize the cross-track errors between the USV and AUV. A subsequent fuzzy logic Waypoint-Heading controller has been developed to provide the desired heading and speed commands to the low-level controller given the Waypoint-Heading goals. High-level mission control has been extensively simulated using Matlab and partially characterized in real-time during testing. Detailed simulation, experimental results and findings will be reported in this paper.},

	Abstract = {Modeling and simulation methods for the seakeeping dynamics of surface vessels vary widely. Higher fidelity models often demand high computational complexity that limits application to offline computation and are not applicable to all development cycles. These models are often based on solving nonlinear fluid flow equations, which cost time and computational power. Simplified models can reduce complexity, supporting rapid development. For developing control and autonomy of small unmanned surface vessels, choosing model fidelity requires a tradeoff between the accuracy of results and complexity of simulation. This thesis compares two methods for modeling and simulating the seakeeping of a small unmanned vessel: Gazebo---an open source, real-time robotics simulator, with an extension that integrates a model for the hydrodynamic wave forces into the rigid-body dynamics engine, and AEGIR---a nonlinear motion solver that leverages a high order boundary element method and numerical methods of motion integration. The forces, motions and runtimes are compared for various wave cases. The results suggest that the simplified models generate vessel motions of acceptable fidelity for the development of autonomy, but that for certain wave environments, the differences are significant. The results provide guidance for how the simplified Gazebo extension could be improved without adding significant computational load.},

	Abstract = {By deploying multiple USVs as a formation fleet, benefits such as wide mission area, improved system autonomy and increased fault-tolerant resilience can be achieved. To efficiently and effectively navigate the USV formation, path planning algorithms are required to generate optimal trajectories and provide practical collision avoidance manoeuvres. In particular, as the USV is underactuated and is restricted by various motion constraints, this paper has presented a new algorithm named the `angle-guidance fast marching square' (AFMS), to make the generated path compliant with vehicle's dynamics and orienta- tion restrictions. Based upon the AFMS, a formation path planning algorithm has been proposed to guide the USVs safely navigating in a cluttered environment. In addition, the formation forming problem has been specifically investigated with the algorithm being developed to make the USVs capable of form- ing the desired shape by following the trajectories from random initial configurations (positions and orientations). In order to eliminate the potential collision risks occurring on the route, a novel priority scheme based upon the distance to the closest point of approaching (DCPA) has also been proposed and developed. Algorithms have been validated on the computer-based simulations and are proven to work effectively in different environments.},

	Abstract = {The trajectory planning and tracking control for an underactuated unmanned surface vessel (USV) were addressed. The reference trajectory was generated by a virtual USV, and the error equation of trajectory tracking for underactuated USV was obtained, which transformed the tracking and stabilization problem of underactuated USV into the stabilization problem of the trajectory tracking error equation. A nonlinear state feedback controller was proposed based on backstepping technique and Lyapunov's direct method. By means of Lyapunov analysis, it is proved that the proposed controller ensures that the solutions of closed loop system have the ultimate boundedness property. Numerical simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.},

The model features a mix of physical based models for the propulsion systems and control surfaces and hydrodynamic coefficient based hull forces. The approach follows the concept of the modular maneuvering model. A quasi-steady assumption is utilized for the seakeeping motion effects. This allows the calm water maneuvering motions to be calculated separately, and the six degree of freedom linear response of waves superimposed. The effects of wind, current, and second order mean drift forces are included.},

	Abstract = {The automatic launch and recovery of an AUV from a USV presents a challenging control problem because control parameters are chosen based on the dynamics of the vehicle, which can change abruptly and significantly when an AUV is jettisoned or docked. Tight control of the vehicle state is required to conduct an underway recovery, with looser requirements for the launch. Experimental testing of an unmanned surface vehicle has been performed to evaluate the performance of several low-level controllers when displacement and drag properties are time-varying and uncertain. Variable mass and drag tests show that the vehicle is best controlled by a model reference adaptive backstepping speed and heading controller. The backstepping controller developed by Liao et. al (2010) is modified to account for an overprediction of necessary control action and motor saturation. It is shown that when an adaptive algorithm is implemented for the surge control subsystem of the modified backstepping controller, the effects of variable mass and drag are mitigated.},

	Abstract = {The issues affecting low-level controller design for a wave-adaptive modular class of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are presented in the context of supporting the autonomous launch and recovery (ALR) of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) aboard an USV. The ALR of an AUV presents a challenging control problem because control parameters are chosen based on the dynamics of the vehicle, which can change abruptly and significantly when an AUV is jettisoned or docked. Tight control of the vehicle state is required to conduct an underway recovery, with looser requirements for the launch. Knowledge of the vehicle response is important for control system design. A simulation, based on physical modeling and experimental results, was developed to support the design of a low level controller. A cascaded proportional derivative (PD) controller has been implemented in simulation and tested for two dissimilar reference speeds and two payload conditions. The simulation results suggest that an adaptive controller may be necessary to overcome the time-varying nature of USV dynamics during an ALR mission.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient dynamic positioning (DP) for marine surface vessels by means of a weather optimal control scheme. Fundamental geometric relations associated with a pendulum in a force field are utilized to obtain fuel- efficient DP functionality. First, weather optimal heading control (WOHC) is achieved through the use of specific surge and yaw controllers which make a vessel behave like a force-field pendulum, employing a virtual suspension point and an associated pendulum length. This design is particularly suitable for sway-unactuated vessels. Second, an intuitive and geometrically- motivated update law is assigned to the virtual suspension point to facilitate weather optimal positioning control (WOPC), which enables a vessel to be positioned at a particular location with a weather optimal heading. Computer simulations incorporating realistic environmental disturbances are used to illustrate the performance of the suggested WOHC and WOPC systems.},

A good thrust allocation can reduce energy consumption as well as small errors. In order to get the mroe energy-efficient thrust allocation strategy, a non-linear allocation optimization model is proposed in this paper. And singular avoidance, power limitations, and mechanical structures are based on Quantum-behaved partical swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO). Numerical solutions is given, which shows that the proposed strategy works well.},

In addition, singularity avoidance for vessels with azimuthing thrusters represent a challenging problem since a non-convex nonlinear program must be solved. This is useful to avoid temporarily loss of controllability in some cases. In this paper, a survey of control allocation methods for overactuated vessels are presented.},

	Abstract = {Three station keeping controllers have been developed which work to minimize displacement of a small outboard- powered vessel from a desired location. Each of these three controllers has a common initial layer that uses fixed-gain feedback control to calculate the desired heading of the vessel. A second control layer uses a common fixed-gain feedback controller to calculate the net forward thrust, one of two algorithms for controlling engine angle (Fixed-Gain PID or PID with Adaptively Augmented Gains), and one of two algorithms for differential throttle control (Fixed-Gain PID and PID with Adaptive Differential Throttle gains), which work together to eliminate heading error. The three selected controllers are evaluated using a numerical simulation of a 33-foot center console vessel with twin outboards that is subject to wave, wind, and current disturbances. Each controller is tested for its ability to maintain position in the presence of three sets of environmental disturbances. These algorithms were tested with current velocity of 1.5 m/s, significant wave height of 0.5 m, and wind speeds of 2, 5, and 10 m/s. These values were chosen to model conditions a small vessel may experience in the Gulf Stream off of Fort Lauderdale. The Fixed-gain PID controller progressively got worse as wind speeds increased, while the controllers using adaptive methodologies showed consistent performance over all weather conditions and decreased heading error by as much as 20%. Thus, enhanced robustness to environmental changes has been gained by using an adaptive algorithm.},

This problem is motivated by the practical need to develop control systems for marine craft that can yield good trajectory tracking performance while keeping some of the desired properties normally associated with path following. The solution described builds on and extends previous work by Hindman and Hauser on sc-called maneuver modified trajectory tracking. An application is made to the problem of designing a control system for the coordinated operation of an autonomous surface craft (ASC) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Simulations with nonlinear models of an underactuated marine craft and a fully actuated underwater vehicle illustrate the performance of the control system derived.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a state feedback based backstepping control algorithm to address the trajectory tracking problem of an underactuated Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) in the horizontal plane. A nonlinear three Degree of Freedom (DOF) underactuated dynamic model for USV is considered, and trajectory tracking controller that can track both curve trajectory and straight line trajectory with high accuracy is designed as the well known Persistent Exciting (PE) conditions of yaw velocity is completely relaxed in our study. The proposed controller has further been enriched by incorporating an integral action additionally for enhancing the steady state performance and control precision of the USV trajectory tracking control system. Global stability of the overall system is proved by Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's Lemma, and then simulation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller designed.},

From the control system design perspective, the characterization of the disturbances acting on the ship is essential to design good performance ship motion controllers and to understand limitations that may prevent the design from achieving the performance specifications. In this paper, we review models and simulation techniques that characterize the impact of these environmental disturbances on marine vessels.

	Abstract = {The use of unmanned vehicles in the field of underwater and marine applications is increasing significantly in recent years. Autonomous vehicles (like AUVs and gliders) or teleoperated ones (like ROVs) are currently employed for executing a number of different underwater tasks, like inspect- ing submerged pipes, executing maintenance interventions on underwater gas- or oil-platforms, collecting environmental or oceanographic data, performing surveys on sites of archeological interest. In parallel with the development of underwater vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), are they also witnessing an increasing interest from the robotic community, especially with the goal of performing surveillance applications, like patrolling and maintaining safeguarded against intruders harbours or other ``crucial'' sites. The potential benefits offered by automated vessels equipped with sensors such as cameras or sonars are quite evident, since they could be used to quickly identify the level of menace of unknown radar track without exposing any human operators to possible threats. However USVs, unlike in the underwater case, have to face the problem of avoiding other vessels which in most cases are manned ones. This is a crucial point especially in that kind of application, where the automated vessel has to move quickly towards a possible menace while at the same time avoiding all the other boats normally operating in the harbour area. Unfortunately, at the current state of art, a reliable methodology to avoid the other vessels and the availability of effective and accurate obstacle detection sensors is still missing. This paper focus its attention on the case of USV used for security applications within a harbour, devising a solution that can be real-time implemented for the obstacle avoidance problem under critical situations where the vehicle as to reach its target as fast as possible while guaranteeing the safety of the other vessels. The presented solution is based on a three layered hierarchical architecture: the first layer computes a global path taking into account static obstacles known a priori, the second layer modifies this path in a locally optimal way (under certain assumptions) exploiting kinematic data of the moving obstacles, while the last layer reactively avoids obstacles for which such data is not available. The paper will be therefore organized as follows: in the first section an introduction and state of art are presented, in the successive section the work will discuss the first layer and the methods for the static obstacles avoidance, while in the third the paper will focus on the moving obstacles and the proposed avoidance algorithm, while also presenting many different detailed simulation results regarding the performances achievable by the overall architecture. Finally a concluding section will also indicate some still open problems and future work directions to be developed.},

	Abstract = {Many conventionalship autopilots use proportional integral and derivative (PID) control algorithms to guide a ship on a fixed heading (course-keeping) or a new heading (course-changing). Such systems usually have a gyrocompass as a single sensory input. Modern sea going vessels have a range of navigation aids most of which may be interconnected to form integrated systems. It is possible to employ the navigational data to provide best estimates of state vectors (Kalman filter) and optimal guidance strategies. Such techniques require powerful computing facilities, particularly if the dynamic characteristics of the vessel are changing, as may be the case in a maneuvering situation or changes in forward speed. This paper investigates the possibility of training a Neural Network to behave in the same manner as an optimal ship guidance system, the objective being to provide a system that can adapt its parameters so that it providesoptimal performance over a range of conditions,without incurring a large computational penalty. A series of simulation studies have been undertaken to compare the performance of a trained neural network with that of the original optimal guidance system over a range of forward speeds. It is demonstrated that a single network has comparable performance to a set of optimal guidance control laws, each computed for different forward speeds.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the subject of straight-line target tracking for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Target-tracking represents motion control scenarios where no information about the target behavior is known in advance, i.e., the path that the target traverses is not defined apriori. Specifically, this work presents the design of a motion control system which enables an underactuated USV to track a target that moves in a straight line at high speed. The motion control system employs a guidance principle originally developed for interceptor missiles, as well as a novel velocity controller inspired by maneuverability and agility concepts found in fighter aircraft literature. The performance of the suggested design is illustrated through full-scale USV experiments in the Trondheimsfjord.},

The review is focused on rigorous control approaches developed using planar autonomous surface vessel models over approxi- mately the last two decades. The controllers are categorized into setpoint, trajectory tracking, and path following approaches with further classification into discontinuous and smooth time- varying control laws for the setpoint control approaches. An overview of the formulation, advantages, and disadvantages of each approach is presented. Although much progress has been made in autonomous underactuated surface vessel control, there remains a need for the evolution of these approaches to achieve robust, real-time control laws that can be implemented on actual autonomous Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) platforms in the presence of high sea states and external disturbances in uncertain and unstructured environments.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, the implementation of genetic pro- gramming (GP) to design a controller structure is assessed. GP is used to evolve control strategies that, given the current and desired state of the propulsion and heading dynamics of a supply ship as inputs, generate the commanded forces required to ma- neuver the ship. The controllers created using GP are evaluated through computer simulations and real maneuverability tests in a laboratory water basin facility. The robustness of each controller is analyzed through the simulation of environmental disturbances. In addition, GP runs in the presence of disturbances are carried out so that the different controllers obtained can be compared. The particular vessel used in this paper is a scale model of a supply ship called CyberShip II. The results obtained illustrate the benefits of using GP for the automatic design of propulsion and navigation controllers for surface ships.},

	Abstract = {Autonomous surface vehicles are with increasing popularity being seen in various applications where automatic control plays an important role. In this paper the problem of two- dimensional trajectory tracking for autonomous marine surface vehicles is addressed using Model Predictive Control (MPC). At each time step, the reference trajectories of a vessel are assumed to be known over a finite time horizon; the MPC controller computes the optimal forces and moment the vessel needs in order to track the trajectory in an optimal way. Based on a horizontal 3 degrees of freedom nonlinear scaled vessel model, we present both nonlinear MPC (NMPC), which solves a constrained multi-variable nonlinear programming problem, and linearized MPC (LMPC), which solves a constrained quadratic programming problem through on-line iterative optimization. In the latter case, the model used in LMPC for prediction is obtained from a successive linearization of the nonlinear vessel model. Comparisons on performance and computational complexity of the two approaches are presented. The effectiveness of the MPC formulations in vessel trajectory tracking, especially the ability of explicitly handling constraints, is demonstrated via simulations.},

Do and Pan (2006) combined backstepping and Lyapunov's direct method for a model ship

Nonlinear MPC for ship path following in Wang (2009) using Lie derivatives, but constarints are difficult to be incorporated

This paper proposes NMPC and LMPC (based on successive linearization)
-- NMPC is full nonlinear model solved at each time step
--- (How) is this different than iLQR?
--- LMPC successfully applied to aircraft control (Keviczky and Balas, 2005)

Uses an elliptical path, compares maximum error from the path at different horizons with different sampling rates.
--- For LMPC, larger N resulted in larger errors, likely due to the linearization method and difference between linearized model and current states if sampling time is too long},

	Abstract = {In this research, a wind feedforward (FF) controller has been developed to augment closed loop feedback controllers for the position and heading station keeping control of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). The performance of the controllers was experimentally tested using a16 foot USV in an outdoor marine environment. The FF controller was combined with three nonlinear feedback controllers, a Proportional--Derivative (PD) controller, a Backstepping (BS) controller, and a Sliding mode (SM) controller, to improve the station-keeping performance of the USV. To address the problem of wind model uncertainties, adaptive wind feedforward (AFF) control schemes are also applied to the FF controller, and implemented together with the BS and SM feedback controllers. The adaptive law is derived using Lyapunov Theory to ensure stability. On-water station keeping tests of each combination of FF and feedback controllers were conducted in the U.S. Intracoastal Waterway in Dania Beach, FL USA. Five runs of each test condition were performed; each run lasted at least 10 minutes. The experiments were conducted in Sea State 1 with an average wind speed of between 1 to 4 meters per second and significant wave heights of less than 0.2 meters. When the performance of the controllers is compared using the Integral of the Absolute Error (IAE) of position criterion, the experimental results indicate that the BS and SM feedback controllers significantly outperform the PD feedback controller (e.g. a 33% and a 44% decreases in the IAE, respectively). It is also found that FF is beneficial for all three feedback controllers and that AFF can further improve the station keeping performance. For example, a BS feedback control combined with AFF control reduces the IAE by 25% when compared with a BS feedback controller combined with a non-adaptive FF controller. Among the eight combinations of controllers tested, SM feedback control combined with AFF control gives the best station keeping performance with an average position and heading error of 0.32 meters and 4.76 degrees, respectively.},

	Annote = {Adaptive controller is advantageous because it reduces dependence on poorly defined wind models available for USV control design

Can be used to provide preemptive correction of wind disturbances from anemometer measurements

Small size vessels have very different responses to waves, current and wind compared to large ships that have been controlled using PID, LQR, Neural Nets, Fuzzy Logic, Sliding Mode, State Feedback Linearization, and Integrator Backstepping.
--- Cannot directly apply large ship control methods to small surface vessel controllers

Feedback controllers are designed to enhance robustness of system, feedforward controllers serve to foresee disturbances before acting on the system

Linear
[19] uses LQR for station keeping performance.
[20] shows that acceleration feedback of PID conrol can improve control performance
[21-23] use state feedback linearization to linearize a nonlinear system and use conventional control techniques, such as pole placement, LQR optimal control theory, etc.
--- Can treat the ship as a mass-spring-damper system
[24] Produced linear controllers for different operating conditions
--- Great quantity of different controllers --- approach is not practical, stability is questionable
--- Linearization can destroy model properties and lose physical insight of the model

Nonlinear
Backstepping uses Lyapunov function to create a feedback control law
--- Feedback linearization cancels all nonlinearities of the system, whereas backstepping allows a flexible design to exploid good damping terms and cancel out destabilizing terms

[26] uses Lyapunov's second method and backstepping for control design
[27] uses adaptive backstepping for a NL system
--- Adaptive backstepping can result in a simple PID control law if system can be simplified to a mass-spring damper
[23] presents steps to create adaptive controllers
[29] suggests backstepping for stationkeeping of a fully-actuated vehicle, but no environmental disturbances were stated in the problem formulation

Lyapunov-based control approach consists of 2 steps:
1) control law is proposed
2) stability results are proven
--- Algorithms based on these proofs have advantages of solving control problem entirely in nonlinear setting, but the controllers rarely show physical insight into the system

Sliding Mode Control defines a surface function of the system's state and ensures that if the system deviates from the defined surface, it is forced back to it.
--- System's dynamic properties depend on the surface choice
--- System has considerable robustness to external peturbations or poorly modeled dynamics
------ In initial transition to the surface, the system may be sensitive to these errors
[30-31] discusses sliding mode control theory
[23, 33, 32] apply sliding mode to marine vehicles

[3] states that USVs are lightweight with large windage ares, so major source of disturbance during station-keeping operations

Robust feedback control laws can be used for current disturbances, but rapid changes like wind are better accounted for with feedforward control [34]

[35] presents three methods of feedforward controllers:
1) Iterative Learning Control (ILC)
2) Iterative Feedback Control (IFC)
3) Adaptive Feedforward Control (AFC)

[36] AFC showed experimentally that AFC provides error reduction.

[37] presents:
1) Infinite Impulse Response Filter (offline)
2) Finite Impulse Response Filter (online)

[38] uses Extreme Learning Control framework with a feedforward network; output weights of feedforward was updated by adaptive projection-based laws derived from Lyapunov theory

E. Adam and J. Marchetti propose that tuning of feedforward controller is not independent of feedback-loop spectral characteristics --- even though feedforward control cannot influence the stability of the feedback system, the control system requires the feedforward controller to be a stable function. Feedforward and feedback controllers should be tuned simultaneously.

H. Havard thesis focuses on dynamic positioning of USVs
- Suggested that wind feedforward controller should be added to the control system to provide enhanced station keeping performances
- Input of feedforward controller is reference points generated by a model


WIND MODEL AND PARAMETER ESTIMATION
Anemometer errors can be minimized, but not eliminated, by sensor calibration [34]
Wind gust and turbulance can cause large measurement errors [3]
A risk of using wind feedforward control is that the speed and direction can vary across different parts of vessel
--- May not be appropriate for larger vessels
--- Can maybe use multiple anemometers to measure the wind field, but assume uniformity for small vessels
--- Placement of anemometer presents another challenge
------ Ideally mounted such that measurements are least affected by wind interaction with vehicle structure
--- Gusts can still not be compensated by wind feedforward control since the actuators have limited propulsion power to move the vehicle in such a high frequency wind gust
[3],[40-43] present wind models for large vessels and floating objects in the ocean, but need to be validated and possibly modified for use on small vehicles
[4] presents wind model for small size USV --- calculated by hand at discrete angles (0, 30, 45, 60)

[28] presents nonlinear control approach for weather optimal position control by estimating environmental disturbances --- vehicle equipped with multiple thrusters and can generate sway forces

Adaptive controllers can outperform non-adaptive controllers for ability to adjust uncertain terms
[50] compares gain scheduling PID, model reference adaptive control, and L1 adaptive control
[51] uses adaptive control to get precise model for dynamic positioning and trajectory tracking
[52] uses adaptive + backstepping for decoupled yaw and sway direction on Nomoto steering model
[53] uses switching controller to handle parameter uncertainty with an underactuated vehicle
[44] extends [53]'s work by designing an adaptive backstepping controller for hydrodynamic estimation
[54] uses adaptive control strategy to counteract disturbances for waypoint tracing in 6 DOF
--- Disturbances assumed to be unknown, constant values
--- Controller proved to be global asymptotically stable
[55] analyzed robustness and stability of adaptive controller
--- Global exponential stability and input/output stability for non adaptive control scheme, global asymptotic stability of the adaptive system, but in simulation only

Control Allocation and Stability Analysis
Azimuthing thruster configs create overactuated system since multiple solutions to controller output can be found to satisfy the control command
[29, 56] uses linear programming
[57] uses quadratic programming
[58] uses evolutionary algorithms 
to find the optimum or near-optimal solution
--- Actuator dynamics create constraints on this system
[29] uses Lagrangian multipler technique as an alternative to this method

[54-55] show control results in simulation
[59] states that validation of USV control laws is often limited to numerical simulation or small-scale experiments rather than full-scale sea trials

WAM-V is designed to mitigate the heave, pitch, and roll response of the payload tray when operating in waves
``keel'' is taken as bottom of the pontoons
Azimuthing thrusters enable overactuated system --- 2 thrusters, 2 linear actuators with 3 DOF

[61] presented system ID test used to develop good estimation of the hydrodynamic terms

Adaptive parameters in the adaptive controller are hydrodynamic parameters and wind model coefficients

Methods for producing good vehicle models can e found in [24], [62], [40], [61]

[43] SNAME source --- subscript denotes cause of the force/moment

Nonlinear damping involves velocity terms of high order, which are very small and can be neglected during station keeping.

[63] presents properties of the equations of motion matrices

Different wind models: [41], [42], [40], [62] (Fossen, which is what is used here)

System ID method inspired by [65], [12]
- Physical parameters in Table 1 can be measured
- X_udot, Y_vdot, N_rdot derived by semi-empirical equations in [24]
- Xu, X_uu, Y_v, N_r need to be identified
--- X_u, X_uu from acceleration tests
--- Y_v and N_r from circle tests
1) Nr isolated from spin test (steady state speed, then 100% -100%) --- Eq 4.29
2) Circle test to get Y_v since only unknown parameter

All hydrodynamic terms were non-dimensionalized and linearized about 1 m/s

Lyapunov exponent gain matrix is chosen based on the value that produces the slowest decay rate of the errors
--- Lowest resonant frequency expected is 0.5 Hz (what is this)?
--- Sampling at 4 Hz

Control allocation work mainly done in [66], presented in the paper

The control laws are designed to force the vehicle trajectory to converge to a reference trajectory generated using an experimentally identified dynamic model of the USV. Experimental results indicate that the backstepping controller is much more effective at tracking trajectories that involve large variations in speed and course angle. The backstepping control law is extended to accommodate a constant ambient flow. Simulations of the reformulated backstepping controller in a flow field further illustrate its effectiveness.},

Model using scheduled parameters based on the nominal speed
- Nomoto turn-rate model with sideslip [19]

Has controller tuning factors that adjust sensitivity of controller and amplitude

RESULTS
Does not present what magnitudes of the thrust was, but it does say that they were out of phase sinusoids of different frequencies for propeller speed and thrust angle, constant propeller speed and sinusoid thrust angle

Backstepping controller clearly outperforms in both cases.

Needs reference path produced in simulation, then experimental verification --- Gazebo sim vs Python sim?

Does the state matrix of my system match meet the Hurwitz Criterion?
- Results in error dynamics are locally and exponentially stable

How can I measure sensitivity of cost other than with the Lagrangian?

	Abstract = {Experimental testing of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) has been performed to evaluate the performance of two low-level controllers when displacement and drag properties are time varying and uncertain. The USV is a 4.3-m-long, 150-kg wave adaptive modular vessel (WAM-V) with an inflatable twin-hull configuration and waterjet propulsion. Open-loop maneuvering tests were conducted to characterize the dynamics of the vehicle. The hydrodynamic coefficients of the vehicle were determined through system identification of the maneuvering data and were used for simulations during control system development. The resulting controllers were experimentally field tested on-water. Variable mass and drag tests show that the vehicle is best controlled by a model reference adaptive backstepping speed and heading controller. The backstepping controller developed by Liao et al. (2010) is modified to account for an overprediction of necessary control action and motor saturation. It is shown that when an adaptive algorithm is implemented for the surge control subsystem of the modified backstepping controller, the effects of variable mass and drag are mitigated.},

[4] incorporates nonlinearities in equations of motion to produce control algorithms with wider performance envelope. [4] also uses MPC to stabilize the vehicle course under large mass variations, but used linearized model for plant dynamics that can fail to capture the vehicle at high speeds.

[17] and [24] use procedures to show that cascaded system of controllers is globally uniformly asymptotically stable.

Reduced equations of motion for surge velocity, sway velocity, and yaw rate

Use scaling factors to prevent actuator chatter

Comparison test of the controllers:
Desired constant speed command + initial desired heading that is identical to desired heading
At specified time, the heading command is changed to 90 deg from the initial --- turn is executed
Steady-state speed and heading error before and after the jump in heading command used as metric
Compared by dividing larger error vs lower error to get a % error performance better.

RESULTS
Backstepping:
Heading: 0.74 deg to 0.41 deg before/after jump, respectively
Speed: 0.25 m/s to 0.24 m/s before/after jump, respectively

Adaptive Backstepping:
Heading: 1.9 deg before/after jump
Speed: 0.065 m/s to 0.070 m/s before/after jump, respectively

Variable Mass and drag experiments also included.


QUESTIONS
How do you choose a Lyapunov function to check stability?
They say that (27) is asymptotically stable for a setpoint of 0, but what about for others? How does this change?},
