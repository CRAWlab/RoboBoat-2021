## 2021 UL Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns UAV

### Basic Concept and Reasoning for this UAV

- The goal of this UAV was to have it built to be a detachable sensor for the ASV. This would allow for the ASV to mauver around faster and this would also allow for the possibility of more points to be obtained in this competition. 

### Covid?

<!-- Anything we want to add???? -->

### Design Fails

In any design process there are always calculations that are off and theoretical thoughts that one would think should work, but actually do not in the real world. These two were not shy to occur in our design process and we thought showing these fails would be an encoragement towards anyone who would like to take on a task like this one. 


#### Tuning the PID Controller

### Other

- Here we will talk about this being our teams senior project and how it relates towards how it will improve our efficiency in the competition.
    - Should we have scrolling pictures of it in CAD form and then in real life? This would show off how close our real model is to our CAD model
    - This is where we can talk about the story of this design and what problems we had to overcome as a team to get our desired end product
      - Troubles:
        - COVID
        - Designs that failed when printed
          - Failed because of print
          - Failed because of unrealistic expectations
        - Soldering failures?
        - Using incorrect circuit breaker
        - Incorrect motor placement
        - Incorrect wiring of motors
        - Incorrect blade positions
        - Parts breaking/loosing pieces
        - Time Management
      - Success:
        - Simulated in Full
        - Great Aesthetics in Product
        - Hovering Drone?
        - Camera Implementation?
        - Waypoint Movement?
        - Aruco Tag accuracy improvement
        - RTK accuracy
