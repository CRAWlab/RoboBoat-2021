# Integration of a UAV to the RoboBoat to aid in task completion and navigation

## Long-term Project Goal
Integrate a drone to the RoboBoat to increase the points gained while completing certain tasks and aid in navigating the courses more efficiently.

## Short-term Goal
To define specific metrics for success.

## Recent Results Overview

1. QR code and Barcode localization
    * Localization processes can be used to identify QR codes or Barcodes in an image. This may be a useful wau to detect the distance between the UAV and ASV. During the localization process a geometric square, "code candidate box", is overlaid the detected QR or Bar code. I believe a distance model could be constructed through machine learning using a simple regression formula. This model could be used to calculate distance depending on the pixel count of the "code candidate box". There are many localization algorithms that are available.

## Plan for the next two weeks


### What are your next steps?


### What work do you expect to have done by next report? What results to you expect?


### Are we on schedule with respect to the GitHub Project and/or Gantt Chart?


# Long-term planning
 As a team we would like to be able to have the success of this project defined in the next few weeks. We want to have the final design concept decided by mid October. We would like to have the drone flying autonomously with a camera attached to the bottom of it within a pre-defined area by the begging of next semester. We want to fully test this design by late February, early March to have time to correct the flaws in the coding and design. We are looking to have the UAV fly autonomously with a camera attached to it, map the course, raise/deliver an object, and have the UAV integrated with ASV by the end of next semester.

## Up coming Paper Deadlines
### Senior projects progress report due every other Thursday starting September 16, 2020.

## Administrative Deadlines
### None yet. Waiting on rules form RoboNation to be released.
